my folder structure looks like this:
AI-Music_generation
	-> Artist name
		->song.mid
and i have a .json file which looks like this, it has around 10,000 entries:
   {
        "artist": "xyz",
        "song": "ookla",
        "url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wro3bqi4Eb8",
    },
i need you to find me duration of the midi file in "HH:MM:SS" format and add it to the .json file.
the updated json file must look like this:
   {
        "artist": "Bell",
        "song": "Tighten Up",
        "url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wro3bqi4Eb8",
        "midi_duration": "HH:MM:SS"
    }
where "midi_duration" : "HH:MM:SS" is the actual duration for the midi file being analyzed.
