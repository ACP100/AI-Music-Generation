Itâ€™s OK! Lyrics
[Verse 1: Natasha, 
Liz
]
Well, I remember all the nights we used to stay at home (
Home
)
On the phone (
Phone
), all night long
We used to talk about the things we really wanna do
I believed in you
I remember how you used to say:
"Have no fear (
No fear
), be okay (
Okay
)"
When you told me anything you want is possible
We could have it all
[Pre-Chorus: Jenny, 
Natasha
]
I believed in you (
All of my dreams
)
I must have been a fool (
Were with you
)
All my dreams were with you
[Chorus: All]
I say it's okay
I can promise you it's alright
You ain't keeping me up all night no more
You're not here but it's okay
I assure you babe, it's alright
You ain't keeping me up all night no more
You're not here but it's okay
[Verse 2: Natasha, 
Jenny
]
Well, now you got to where you wanted like I knew you would
Cash, car, house (
House
), it's all good (
All good
)
Is it why you never come around here no more?
Like you did before
Got it all, that's the way it seems
Looks like you (
Like you
), live your dreams (
Your dreams
)
And I hope your life will turn out for the better now
When I'm not around
