Lick It Lyrics
I met a real cutie
He had a nice type booty
He seemed to be the freaky lover type
Let's cut right through the chase
Come on and get a taste
You gotta lick it
Before we kick it
You gotta get it soft and wet
So we can kick it
You gotta lick it
Before we kick it
You gotta take that extra step
So we can kick it
My lips are sweet as candy
I need a man that's handy
Don't be tease, just gimme what I like
I'm full of freakiness
Come on and get with this
And make me purr so baby we can get high (miaow)
You gotta lick it
Before we kick it
You gotta get it soft and wet
So we can kick it
You gotta lick it
Before we kick it
You gotta take that extra step
So we can kick it
