Blood Runs Cold Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I heard this line one time about trying to save the world
Have you ever tried to save yourself?
A wide eyed suicide drive remains a fake
As if you'd ever, ever go and make the same mistake
Strung out as the night comes crawling
Your halo of thorns is falling
[Chorus]
Blood runs cold
I feel it in my bones
But you don't know your time is up
Blood runs cold
[Verse 2]
Somebody somewhere is screaming out the words
Do they ever really ease the pain?
I guess what I'm trying to say is whose life is it anyway
Because living, living is the best revenge you can play
This fall from grace, I see your face it's over
[Chorus]
Blood runs cold
I feel it in my bones
But you don't know your time is up
Blood runs cold
