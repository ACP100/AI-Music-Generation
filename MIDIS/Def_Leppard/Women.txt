In the beginning, God made the land
Then he made the water and creatures, then he made man
He was born with a passion, love and hate
A restless spirit with a need for a mate
But there was something missing, something lost
So he came with the answer, here's what it cost
One part love, one part wild, one part lady, one part child
[Chorus]
I give you (Women, women)
Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
(Women, women) Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them

The animal instinct, the wanton man
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite
And filling with emotion he took a bite
It was one part love, one part child
One part lover, one part wild
[Chorus]
I give you (Women, women)
Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
(Women, women) Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
