Heaven Is Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hey boys, Miss Magic is back
No Hollywood waste or tinsel trash
A street kid, she's no stray cat
Heaven on legs, she's feline flash
Takes a good woman to play a good man
And no one plays like Heaven can
[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Leave your name at the sound of the tone
Call you right back when I get home"
Better watch out when we're all alone
[Chorus]
Heaven is a girl I know so well
She makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have
And she makes me feel better when I'm feeling bad
[Verse 2]
Hey guys, Miss Magic is mine
No silicone smile, she's a vintage wine
Bombshell blonde, red lipstick on
Aqualine fine, she's a real wild one
[Pre-Chorus]
