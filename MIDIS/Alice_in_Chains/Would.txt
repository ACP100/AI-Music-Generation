Would? Lyrics
The song concerns the late lead singer of Mother Love Bone, Andrew Wood, who died of a heroin overdose in 1990.  Would? and Wood are homophones.
It is written by Jerry Cantrell and produced by Rick Parashar.
[Intro: Jerry Cantrell]
Would
[Verse 1: Jerry Cantrell, 
Jerry Cantrell & Layne Staley
]
Know me, broken 
by my master
Teach thee on child of 
love hereafter
[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way
[Verse 2: Jerry Cantrell, 
Jerry Cantrell & Layne Staley
]
Drifting body, it's 
sole desertion
Flying not yet, 
quite the notion
[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way
[Guitar Solo: Jerry Cantrell]
[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way, yeah
