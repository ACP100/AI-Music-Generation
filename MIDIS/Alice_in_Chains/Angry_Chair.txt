Angry Chair Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Sitting on an angry chair
Angry walls that steal the air
Stomach hurts and I don't care
[Pre-Chorus 1]
What do I see across the way? Hey
See myself molded in clay, oh
Stares at me, yeah, I'm afraid, hey
Changing the shape of his face, oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
Candles red, I have a pair
Shadows dancing everywhere
Burning on the angry chair
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Little boy made a mistake,
 hey
Pink cloud has now turned to gray
, oh
All that I want is to play, hey
Get on your knees, time to pray, oh
[Chorus]
I don't mind, yeah, 
I don't mind, I-I-I
I don't mind, yeah, I don't mind, I-I-I
Lost my mind, yeah, but I don't mind, I-I-I
Can't find it anywhere, I don't mind, I-I-I
