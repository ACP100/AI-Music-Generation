Brother Lyrics
“Brother” was written by guitarist Jerry Cantrell about his younger brother. When Cantrell’s parents divorced, Jerry lived with his mother while his brother lived with his father.
[Intro: Jerry Cantrell & Ann Wilson]
Hm, hm, hm hm, hm, hm
Hm, hm, hm hm, hm
Hm, hm, hm hm, hm, hm
Hm, hm, hm hm, hm
[Verse 1: Jerry Cantrell]
Frozen in the place I hide
Not afraid to paint my sky
With some who say I've lost my mind
Brother, try and hope to find...
[Chorus: Jerry Cantrell 
with Ann Wilson
]
You 
were always so far away
I know that pain,
 so don't you run away
Like you used to do
Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm
[Bridge: Jerry Cantrell & Ann Wilson]
Hm, hm, hm hm, hm, hm
Hm, hm, hm hm, hm
Hm, hm, hm hm, hm, hm
Hm, hm, hm hm, hm
[Verse 2: Jerry Cantrell]
Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is
Pulling them hard as I can
