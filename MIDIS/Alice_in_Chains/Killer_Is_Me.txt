Killer Is Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Don't need a gun
Pointed at me
No need to run
Killer is me
Killer is me
[Chorus]
So, the sun
Shines upon me
I'm havin' fun
The killer is me
[Verse 2]
Insane, the mind
In the name of me
Can't find the time
To let things be
[Verse 2]
Insane, the mind
In the name of me
Can't find the time
To let things be
Let things be
