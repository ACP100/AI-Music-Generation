Hunting High and Low Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Here I am
And within the reach of my hands
She's sound asleep
And she's sweeter now than the wildest dream
Could've seen her
And I watch her slipping away
[Chorus]
But I know I'll be hunting high and low, high
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
Hunting high and low, high
There's no end to lengths I'll go to
[Verse 2]
Find her again
Upon this, my dreams are depending
Through the dark
I sense the pounding of her heart
Next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find
[Chorus]
So I guess I'll be hunting high and low, high
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
High and low, high
Do you know what it means to love you?
