Gut Feeling Lyrics
Something about the way you taste
Makes me want to clear my throat
There's a method to your movements
That really gets my goat
I looked for silver linings
But you're rotten to the core
I've had just about all I can take
You know I can't take it no more
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
Centered 'round long time ago
On your ability to torment
Then you took your tongs of love
And stripped away my garment
I looked for silver linings
But you're rotten to the core
I've had just about all I can take
You know I can't take it no more
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
