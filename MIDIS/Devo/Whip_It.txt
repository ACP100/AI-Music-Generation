[Verse: Gerald Casale & 
Mark Mothersbaugh
]
Crack that whip, 
give the past a slip
Step on a crack, 
break your momma's back
[Chorus: Mark Mothersbaugh & 
Gerald Casale
]
When a problem comes along, 
you must whip it
Before the cream sets out too long, 
you must whip it
When something's going wrong, 
you must whip it
[Post-Chorus:  Gerald Casale & Mark Mothersbaugh]

To whip it, whip it good
[Chorus: Mark Mothersbaugh & 
 Gerald Casale 
]
When a good time turns around,

You will never live it down 
unless you whip it
No one gets away 
until they whip it
[Bridge: Mark Mothersbaugh]
I say whip it, whip it good
I say whip it, whip it good
[Verse: Mark Mothersbaugh & 
Gerald Casale
]
Crack that whip, 
give the past a slip
Step on a crack, 
break your momma's back
