Last Stop: This Town Lyrics
The song is about Eâ€™s sister Elizabeth, who committed suicide prior to the recording of Electro-Shock Blues.
[Verse 1]
You're dead but the world keeps spinning
Take a spin through the world you left
It's getting dark a little too early
Are you missing the dearly bereft?
[Bridge]
Taking flight and you could be here tomorrow
Taking flight, well, you could get here tonight
I'm gonna fly on down for the last stop to this town
What?
I'm gonna fly on down then fly away
Well, alright
Get down
[Verse 2]
Takin' a spin through the neighborhood
The neighbors scream, "Whatchya talkin' bout?"
Cause they don't know how to let you in
And I can't let you out
What if I was not your only friend in this world
Can you take me where you're going if you're never coming back?
[Refrain]
I'm gonna fly on down for the last stop to this town
I'm gonna fly on down then fly away on my way
