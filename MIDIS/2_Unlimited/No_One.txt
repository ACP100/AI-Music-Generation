No One Lyrics
[Verse 1: Ray Slijngaard]
I've been searchin' a long time
And I just don't know
I try to catch solutions
I try to catch the flow
Thoughts running through my mind
Maybe the man in the front, yo, was the man from behind
Where is the place
Where I don't have to watch my back?
When I can just go out
Without protecting my sex?
Will it come?
No-one knows
Hey yo! No-one knows
[Chorus: Anita Doth]
No-one can resist the desire
To escape to paradise
But it seems like there's nothing else to do
Than dream and fantasize
[Post-Chorus: Ray Slijngaard]
On and on till the break of dawn...
Oh, oh, oh... yeah, no-one knows
[Verse 2: Ray Slijngaard]
You better recognise when I pass your way
It's the techno rap singer by the name of Ray
Can we compromise to have a better place?
Can we reach the goal to have an equal race?
So amazing how things change
But we're growing up
So it ain't that strange
The inspiration comes through the nation
Will it last?
No-one knows
