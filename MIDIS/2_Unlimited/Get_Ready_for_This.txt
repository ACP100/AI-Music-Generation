Get Ready For This Lyrics
[Sample: The D.O.C.]
Y'all ready for this?
[Instrumental Chorus]
[Verse 1: Ray Slijngaard]
Get down with the sound, house on the ground
Freeze when I squeeze, drop to your knees
You must obey, I'm in here to stay
Ready to take you around the way
So youâ€™re ready for this, mind your own biz
'Cause I am bad, yeah, the microphone wiz
No need to sit, 'cause we're 2 Unlimited
Ready, ready, ready for this
[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
[Instrumental Chorus]
[Verse 2: Ray Slijngaard]
Feel the base, you just get closer
Be impressed by the words I chose so
Once again kickin' it live
Doin' everything yo just to survive
Above the law, I think I stand
Here on stage with a mic in my hand
Bustin' it loud into the crowd
The age is 20, 
I'm from the south
