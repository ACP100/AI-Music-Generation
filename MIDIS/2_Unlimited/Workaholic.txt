Workaholic Lyrics
[Intro]
Okay, let's go to work!
Who the fuck are you?
The workaholic
The workaholic
[Verse 1: Ray]
The workaholic he works every day
24 hours, no time to play
He won't quit, he's addicted to work
I think he's going out like a jerk
Working, working, what can you do?
See the light from a different point of view
Ready in the morning for the bell to chime
I think he's glad it's working time!
[Bridge]
The workaholic
[Chorus: Anita]
Work your body, baby, work your soul
Keep on workin', workin' to the bone
Work your body, baby, work your soul
I'm a workaholic when I'm on the floor
[Bridge]
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, letâ€™s go to work!
The workaholic
