Here I Go Lyrics
[Anita:] Ohhh... Why don't you catch me?
[Ray:] Catch me, cause I falling deep down below
[Anita:] I'm falling! Yeah!
[Ray:] There's no way out, man you try to escape
Concentrate on your mind 'cause it might just break
Into half, crack down fast
I keep my face straight no need to laugh
I did some right, I did some wrong
I regret these things, but I gotta stay strong
I feel the pressure, now don't you know?
Catch me, 'cause I'm falling deep down below
[Anita:] Oh, I can't escape, I'm trapped there is no safe place to go
And I do regret the things I did, but how on earth could I know?
Here I go!
Here I go catch me I'm falling deep
Here I go
Here I go catch me I'm falling falling
Here I go
[Ray:] Here I go
Here I go
[Anita:] Here I go
[Ray:] Catch me, come on
