No Limit Lyrics
[Intro: Ray Slijngaard]
Let me hear you say yeah! (Yeah!)
Let me hear you say yeah! (Yeah!)
[Interlude]
[Pre-Chorus: Anita Doth]
No no, no no no no, no no no no, no no there's no limit
No no, no no no no, no no no no, no no there's no limit
[Chorus: Anita Doth]
No, no limits, we'll reach for the sky
No valley too deep, no mountain too high
No, no limits, won't give up the fight
We do what we want, and we do it with pride
[Refrain: Ray Slijngaard]
Let me hear you say yeah! (Yeah!)
[Verse 1: Ray Slijngaard]
Hard to the core, I feel the floor
When I'm on the stage, yo, you'll ask for more
I'm on the edge, I know the ledge
I work real hard to collect my cash
Tick tick ticka tick take your time
When I'm goin' I'm goin' for mine
Open you ears and you will hear it
I tell you this 'cause there's no limit!
