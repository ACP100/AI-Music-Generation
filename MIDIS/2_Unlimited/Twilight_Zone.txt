Twilight Zone Lyrics
[Verse 1: Ray Slijngaard]
First to the bass into the jam
Then let the music take command
Back to back to another dimension
Stop the force and pay some attention
Music to party, music to dance
The new follow-up of public demand
Slick as five da la megaphone
Take you down to the Twilight Zone
[Verse 2: Ray Slijngaard]
Enter the club and turn the body upside down
Grab the microphone, it's upon the sound
You want more, more you get
We're 2 Unlimited in effect!
Check up the sound and stop this distortion
When we get the fittess, here's another portion
Just lay back as we take control
Take you down into the Twilight Zone
[Chorus: 
Anita Doth
]
This is the twilight zone
And you're not on your own
We'll take you to the Twilight Zone
It is the Twilight Zone
You better shake your bones
And come on down the Twilight Zone
