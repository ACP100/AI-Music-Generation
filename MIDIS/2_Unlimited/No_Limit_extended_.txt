No Limit (Extended) Lyrics
Lemme hear ya say yeah! (yeah!)
Lemme hear ya say yeah! (yeah!)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no ,no ,no, no there's no limit!
No, no, no ,no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no there's no limit!
No no limits, we'll reach for the sky!
No valley to deep
No mountain too high
No no limits, won't give up the fight!
We do what we want and we do it with pride
Lemme hear ya say yeah! (yeah!)
Hard to the core, I feel the floor
When I'm on stage, yo, ya answer more
I'm on the edge, I know the ledge, I work real hard to collect my cash!
Tick tick ticka tick take your time, when I'm goin' I'm goin' for mine
Open your ears and you will hear it
I tell you this 'cause there's no limit!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no ,no ,no, no, no, no there's no limit!
No no limits, we'll reach for the sky!
No valley to deep
No mountain too high
No no limits, won't give up the fight!
We do what we want and we do it with pride
