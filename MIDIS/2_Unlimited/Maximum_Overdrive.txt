Maximum Overdrive Lyrics
[Intro: Anita Doth]
Join me for a ride, speed up the music
Join me for a ride, maximum overdrive
Join me for a ride, speed up the music
Join me for a ride, maximum overdrive
[Chorus: Anita Doth]
Join me for a ride, speed up the music
Join me for a ride, maximum overdrive
Join me for a ride, speed up the music
Join me for a ride, maximum overdrive
[Post-Chorus: Ray Slijngaard]
Speed it up, the bass
Take you down into the maximum
Maximum overdrive
[Verse 1: Ray Slijngaard]
The heat is on, ah yeah, we gotta move on
Check the brakes and listen to the new song
We gonna overdrive ya to the maximum
Now I show you, our trip's just begun
Rough and tough, with your hands on the steering wheel
The will is strong, the heart as steel
The maximum overload, king of the road
Feel the tension high up in your throat
