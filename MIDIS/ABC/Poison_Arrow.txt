[Verse 1]
If I were to say to you:
"Can you keep a secret?"
Would you know just what to do
Or where to keep it?

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow

Right on the target but wide of the mark
What I thought was fire was only the spark
The sweetest melody is an unheard refrain
So lower your sights
Yeah, but raise your aim, raise your aim
