4 Ever 2 Gether Lyrics
[Intro]
Evil
Evil
Evil
Evil
Evil
Evil
Speak no evil
Speak no evil
[Verse 1]
You can tell me how to run my life
You can tell me drugs you're using
You're talking loud and saying nothing
Walking proud and going nowhere fast, you know
If you could tell me how to find belief
If you told me, I'd believe you'd
Speak no evil, hear no evil, see no evil
I'll close my eyes, you know love grows
[Chorus]
4 ever 2 gether for years to come
For love too strong for us to part
4 ever 2 gether for years to come
For love too strong for us to part
