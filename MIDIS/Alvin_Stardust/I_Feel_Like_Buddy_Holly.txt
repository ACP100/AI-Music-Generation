I Feel Like Buddy Holly Lyrics
I watched the planes come in on the early morning flights
But I couldn't stand to see them land without you
Now I'm fumbling through my 45s on another endless night
Every single line's going back in time
Tell me this is nothing new
Well I feel like Buddy Holly 'cos it's raining in my heart
All the sad songs take me back to you
Now that we are apart
Now I know how Paul McCartney felt when he got up to say
"I wish it was yesterday"
So I sit here playing solitaire
It's a game I know so well ever since the day you called to say it's over
Now I made my reservation at the Heart Break Hotel
While I'm living without you
I'm thinking about you like only the lonely do
Well I feel like Buddy Holly 'cos it's raining in my heart
All the sad songs take me back to you
Now that we are apart
Now I know what Paul Simon meant by the words he found
"I wish I was homeward bound"
Well I feel like Buddy Holly 'cos it's raining in my heart
All the sad songs take me back to you
Now that we are apart
Now I know how Paul McCartney felt when he got up to say
"I wish it was yesterday"
