Whatâ€™s New Pussycat? Lyrics
What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh
Pussycat pussycat
I've got flowers and lots of hours
To spend with you
So go and powder
Your cute little pussycat nose
Pussycat, pussycat I love you
Yes I do
You and your pussycat nose
What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh
Pussycat, pussycat
You're so thrilling
And I'm so willing
To care for you
So go and make up
Your big little pussycat eyes
