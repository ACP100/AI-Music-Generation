Wheel of Fortune Lyrics
[Chorus]
What you gonna tell your dad?
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad
If this wheel lets you down?
My love is my engine
And you might be fuel
Stop acting cool
Just bet you might win
I'm not too cool
(We're gonna make your move)
[Verse 1]
Don't push me
I don't want to, can't you see it?
Fast and slowly
And don't count your chicks
Before they're hatched, baby
[Chorus]
What you gonna tell your dad?
It's like a wheel of fortune
What you gonna tell your dad
If this wheel lets you down?
My love is my engine
And you might be fuel
Stop acting cool
Just bet you might win
I'm not too cool
