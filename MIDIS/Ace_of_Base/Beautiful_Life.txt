Beautiful Life Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You can do what you want, just seize the day
What you're doin' tomorrow's gonna come your way
Don't you ever consider givin' up
You will find, oh-oh
[Chorus]
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
I just wanna be here beside you
(And stay until the break of dawn)
[Verse 2]
Take a walk in the park when you feel down
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up
See the nature in bloom, a laughing child
Such a dream, woah-oh
[Chorus]
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
I just wanna be here beside you
(Oh, yeah, alright)
I just wanna be here beside you
(And stay until the break of dawn)
