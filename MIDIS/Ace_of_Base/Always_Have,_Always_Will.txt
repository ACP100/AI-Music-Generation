Always Have, Always Will Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was mesmerized when I first met you
I wouldn't let myself believe
That you could step right out of my wildest dreams
But you didn't know that secret part of me
Until we kissed and made it open up so easily
[Chorus]
I always have (even though it didn't show)
I always will
You know that I just wanna touch you whenever you're close to me
I always have (doesn't matter where we go)
I always will
You know that I just wanna show you just how much you mean to me
Always have
Always will...
[Verse 2]
Everything that you give into
Everything you'll ever need
Is locked up somewhere deep inside of me
You gotta know but more importantly
You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy
[Chorus]
I always have (even though it didn't show)
I always will
You know that I just wanna touch you whenever you're close to me
I always have (doesn't matter where we go)
I always will
You know that I just wanna show you just how much you mean to me
