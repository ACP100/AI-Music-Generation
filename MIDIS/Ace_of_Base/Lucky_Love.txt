Lucky Love Lyrics
[Intro]
Life is a paradise
Whoa, whoa, yeah
[Chorus]
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
[Verse 1]
I believe life could be paradise once again (Again, again, again)
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within
Close your eyes, it's something for you
[Chorus]
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
I'm a prisoner of hope, I know
[Verse 2]
We are young and we are old
We're fallin' like leaves (Like leaves, like leaves, like leaves)
And your heart's so full of soul
It makes me believe
Once again, it's something for you
