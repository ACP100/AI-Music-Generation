Life Is a Flower Lyrics
[Chorus]
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
[Verse 1]
When every race is run
And the day is closing in
I don't care about the world
I'm living for the light
Don't cry for me today, ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
