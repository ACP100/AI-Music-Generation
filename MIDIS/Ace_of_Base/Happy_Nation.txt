Happy Nation Lyrics
[Intro: Jonas Berggren]
Laudate omnes gentes laudate
Magnificat in secula
Et anima mea laudate
Magnificat in secula
[Chorus: Malin Berggren]
Happy nation
Living in a happy nation
Where the people 
understand
And dream of perfect man
Situation
Leading to sweet salvation
For the people, for the good
For mankind, brotherhood
[Post-Chorus: Jonas Berggren]
We're traveling in time
[Verse: Malin Berggren]
Ideas by man
And only that will last
And over time
We've learned from the past
That no man's fit
To rule the world alone
A man will die
But not his ideas
