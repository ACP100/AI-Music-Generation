Baby Sittinâ€™ Boogie Lyrics
(gggggggggggggggg da da da-da-da-da!)
My girl babysits for someone on her block
Then I come up to join her and we start to rock
The baby hears the beat and, man, it is a shock
When he goes (ggggggggggggg ggggggg)
A rockin' type a boogie is the kind a song
That makes this little baby wanna sing along
And though he maybe gets the tune a little wrong
He still goes (boogie-on-na-day)
He isn't too young to really feel the beat
He rocks back and forth in his little seat
He claps both his hands and he taps his feet
And he sings (doo-doo-da-da-da-da-da)
He is a hully-gully-bouncin-baby-boy
You know the record player is his favorite toy
And don't forget he's everybody's pride and joy
When he goes (ooo-ah-ge-he)
(Yo-a-ah-ah)
(Ladaladalada)
