[Chorus]
Make the world go away
And get it off my shoulders
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away
[Verse 1]
Do you remember when you loved me
Before the world took me astray?
If you do then forgive me
And make the world go away
[Chorus]
Make the world go away
And get it off my shoulders
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away
[Verse 2]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'll make it up day by day
Just say you love me like you used to
And make the world go away
[Chorus]
Make the world go away
And get it off my shoulders
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away
