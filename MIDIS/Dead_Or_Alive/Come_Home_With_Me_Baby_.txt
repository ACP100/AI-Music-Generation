Come Home (With Me Baby) Lyrics
(Take a trip you'll never forget)
(Let's Rock!)
(Take a trip you'll never forget)
(Let's Rock!)
(Ooh you must be lucky)
Same place
After midnight
Saw you
Looking so nice
Hot stuff
Pants on fire
Please me
I want you now
I'm born to flirt
You're born to run
Let's get together
And get it on
Come home with me baby
Ooh, ya must be lucky
No I don't do this for anyone
Come home with me baby
Ooh! ya must be lucky
I was looking for somebody
And you got the body I want
Red hot the body
You got the body I want
You got the body I want
Ooh!
