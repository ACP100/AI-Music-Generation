On Your Shore Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Strange how my heart beats
To find myself upon your shore
Strange how I still feel
My loss of comfort gone before
[Verse 2]
Cool waves wash over
And drift away with dreams of youth
So time is stolen
I cannot hold you long enough
[Bridge]
And so this is where I should be now
Days and nights falling by
Days and nights falling by me
I know of a dream I should be holding
Days and nights falling by
Days and nights falling by me
[Verse 3]
Soft blue horizons
Reach far into my childhood days
As you are rising
To bring me my forgotten ways
