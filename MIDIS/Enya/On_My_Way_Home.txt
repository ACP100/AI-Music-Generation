On My Way Home Lyrics
11th and final track off her 1995 album The Memory of Trees.
[Verse 1]
I have been given
One moment from heaven
As I am walking
Surrounded by night
Stars high above me
Make a wish under moonlight
[Chorus]
On my way home
I remember
All the good days
On my way home
I remember
All the best days
I'm on my way home
I can remember
Every new day
[Verse 2]
I move in silence
With each step taken
Snow falling round me
Like angels in flight
Far in the distance
Is my wish under moonlight
