Once You Had Gold Lyrics
9th track off her 1995 album The Memory of Trees.
[Verse 1]
Once you had gold
Once you had silver
Then came the rains
Out of the blue
[Chorus 1]
Ever and always
Always and ever
Time gave both darkness and dreams to you
[Verse 2]
Now you can see
Spring becomes autumn
Leaves become gold
Falling from view
[Chorus 2]
Ever and always
Always and ever
No-one can promise a dream come true
Time gave both darkness and dreams to you
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
What is the dark
Shadows around you
Why not take heart
In the new day?
