Hope Has a Place Lyrics
7th track off her 1995 album The Memory of Trees.
[Verse 1]
One look at love and you may see
It weaves a web over mystery
All raveled threads can rend apart
For hope has a place in the lover's heart
Hope has a place in a lover's heart
[Verse 2]
Whispering world, a sigh of sighs
The ebb and the flow of the ocean tides
One breath, one word may end or may start
A hope in a place of the lover's heart
Hope has a place in a lover's heart
[Chorus]
Look to love, you may dream
And if it should leave then give it wings
But if such a love is meant to be
Hope is home and the heart is free
[Verse 3]
Under the heavens we journey far
On roads of life we're the wanderers
So let love rise, so let love depart
Let hope have a place in the lover's heart
Hope has a place in a lover's heart
