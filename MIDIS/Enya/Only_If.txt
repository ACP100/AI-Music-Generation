Only If... Lyrics
[English Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
When there's a shadow you reach for the sun
When there is love then you look for the one
And for the promises there is the sky
And for the heavens are those who can fly
[Chorus]
If you really want to you can hear me say
Only if you want to will you find a way
If you really want to you can seize the day
Only if you want to will you fly away
[Post-Chorus]
Da-da duh-da, da-da-da duh-da
Da-da duh-da, da-da-da duh-da
Da-da duh-da, da-da-da duh-da
Da-da duh da
[Verse 2]
When there's a journey you follow a star
When there's an ocean you sail from afar
And for the broken heart there is the sky
And for tomorrow are those who can fly
