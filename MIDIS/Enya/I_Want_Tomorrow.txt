I Want Tomorrow Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Dawn breaks; there is blue in the sky
Your face before me
Though I don't know why
Thoughts disappearing like tears from the Moon
[Verse 2]
Waiting here, as I sit by the stone
They came before me
Those men from the Sun
Signs from the heavens say I am the one
[Chorus]
Now you're here, I can see your light
This light that I must follow
You, you may take my life away
So far away
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrow
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Now you're here, I can see your light
This light that I must follow
You, you may take my life away
So far away
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrow
