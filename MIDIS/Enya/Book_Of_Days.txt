Book of Days Lyrics
5th track off her 1991 album Shepherd Moons.
[English Lyrics]
[Verse 1]
One day, one night, one moment
My dreams could be tomorrow
One step, one fall, one falter
East or west, over earth or by ocean
One way to be my journey
This way could be my book of days
[Bridge]
Ó lá go lá, mo thuras
An bealach fada romham
Ó oíche go hoíche, mo thuras
Na scéalta nach mbeidh a choích
[Verse 2]
No day, no night, no moment
Can hold me back from trying
I'll flag, I'll fall, I'll falter
I'll find my day maybe
Far and away
Far and away
[Interlude]
