China Roses Lyrics
6th track off her 1995 album The Memory of Trees.
[Verse 1]
Who can tell me if we have heaven
Who can say the way it should be
Moonlight holly, the 
Sappho Comet
Angel's tears below a tree
[Verse 2]
You talk of the break of morning
As you view the new aurora
Cloud in crimson, the Key of Heaven
One love carved in acajou
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
One told me of China Roses
One a thousand nights and one night
Earth's last picture, the end of evening
Hue of indigo and blue
[Bridge]
A new moon leads me to
Woods of dreams and I follow
A new world waits for me;
My dream, my way
