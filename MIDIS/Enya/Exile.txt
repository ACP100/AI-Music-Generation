Exile Lyrics
4th track off her 1988 album Watermark.
[Verse 1]
Cold as the northern winds
In December mornings
Cold is the cry that rings
From this far distant shore
[Verse 2]
Winter has come too late
Too close beside me
How can I chase away
All these fears deep inside?
[Chorus]
I'll wait the signs to come
I'll find a way
I will wait the time to come
I'll find a way home
[Verse 3]
My light shall be the moon
And my path, the ocean
My guide, the morning star
As I sail home to you
[Chorus]
I'll wait the signs to come
I'll find a way
I will wait the time to come
I'll find a way home
