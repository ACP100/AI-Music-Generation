Caribbean Blue Lyrics
[Intro]
Eurus
Āfer Ventus
[Verse 1]
So the world goes 'round and 'round
With all you ever knew
They say the sky high above
Is Caribbean blue
[Instrumental break]
[Verse 2]
If every man says all he can
If every man is true
Do I believe the sky above
Is Caribbean blue?
[Bridge]
Boreās
Zephryus
[Instrumental break]
[Verse 3]
If all we told was turned to gold
If all we dreamed was new
Imagine sky high above
In Caribbean blue
