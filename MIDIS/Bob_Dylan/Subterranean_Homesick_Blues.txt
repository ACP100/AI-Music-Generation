[Verse 1]
Johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
The man in a trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
Look out, kid, it's somethin' you did
God knows when, but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in a big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills, you only got ten
[Verse 2]
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but
The phone's tapped anyway

Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May, orders from the DA
Look out kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip-toes, don't try NoDoz
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
[Verse 3]
Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a inkwell
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail
Look out, kid, you're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, and watch the parking meters
