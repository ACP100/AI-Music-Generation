I Want You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The guilty undertaker sighs
The lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But it’s not that way
I wasn’t born to lose you
[Chorus]
I want you, I want you
I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you
[Verse 2]
The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you
[Chorus]
I want you, I want you
Yes I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you
