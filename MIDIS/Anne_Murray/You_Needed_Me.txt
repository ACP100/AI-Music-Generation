You Needed Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I cried a tear
You wiped it dry
I was confused
You cleared my mind
I sold my soul
You bought it back for me
And held me up
And gave me dignity
Somehow, you needed me
[Chorus]
You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again
You put me high
Upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me
You needed me
[Bridge]
And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true!
I needed you
And you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave? I'd be a fool
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares
