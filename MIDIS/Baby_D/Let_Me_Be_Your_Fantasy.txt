Let Me Be Your Fantasy Lyrics
Breakbeat group Baby D topped the UK singles chart in November 1994 with this song which had been conceived two years earlier at the height of the rave scene.
(Let me be your fantasy)
(Let me be your fantasy)
(Let me be your fantasy)
I'll take you up to the highest heights
Let's spread our wings and fly away
Surround you with love that's pure delight
Release your spirit, set you free
Come and feel my energy
Let's be as one in soul and mind
I'll fill your world with ecstasy
Touch all your dreams deep down inside
Let me be your fantasy
Let me be your fantasy, yeah
Let me be your fantasy
Let me be your fantasy
(Let me be your fantasy)
(Let me touch your dreams)
(Just spread your wings, fly away)
Come take a trip to my wonderland
Let's spread our wings and fly away
Feel oceans of love flow through your hands
See visions, colours every day
