I Will Remember You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I will be walking one day
Down a street far away
And see a face in the crowd and smile
Knowing how you made me laugh
Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past
I will remember you
[Verse 2]
Look in my eyes while you're near
Tell me what's happening here
See that I don't want to say goodbye
Our love is frozen in time
I'll be your champion and you will be mine
I will remember, I will remember you
[Bridge]
Later on
When this fire is an ember
Later on
When the night's not so tender
Given time
Though it's hard to remember, darlin'
I will be holding
I'll still be holding to you
I will remember you
