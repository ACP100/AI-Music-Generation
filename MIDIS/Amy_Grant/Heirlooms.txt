Heirlooms Lyrics
Up in the attic
Down on my knees
Lifetimes of boxes
Timeless to me
Letters and photographs
Yellowed with years
Some bringing laughter
Some bringing tears
Time never changes the memories
The faces of loved ones
Who bring to me
All that I come from
And all that I live for
And all that I'm going to be
My precious family
Is more than an heirloom to me
Wisemen and shepherds
Down on their knees
Bringing their treasures
To lay at His feet
Who was this Wonder
Baby, yet King
Living and dying
He gave life to me
