El-Shaddai Lyrics
[Chorus]
El Shaddai, El Shaddai
El Elyon na Adonai
Age to age You're still the same
By the power of the name
El Shaddai, El Shaddai
Erkamka na Adonai
We will praise and lift You high, El Shaddai
[Verse 1]
Through Your love and through the ram
You saved the son of Abraham
Through the power of Your hand
Turned the sea into dry land
To the outcast on her knees
You were the God who really sees
And by Your might
You set Your children free
[Chorus]
El Shaddai, El Shaddai
El Elyon na Adonai
Age to age You're still the same
By the power of the name
El Shaddai, El Shaddai
Erkamka na Adonai
We will praise and lift You high, El Shaddai
