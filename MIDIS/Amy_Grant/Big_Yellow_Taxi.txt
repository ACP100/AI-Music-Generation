Big Yellow Taxi Lyrics
[Verse 1]
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique
And a swinging hot spot
[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
[Verse 2]
They took all the trees
And put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people
Twenty-five bucks just to see 'em
[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
