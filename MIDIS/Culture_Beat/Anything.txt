Anything Lyrics
Is there anything more
I can do for you
Should my hair be red
Or shall it be blue
Is there anything more
I can do for you
Shall I let the green grass
Turn black for you
Is there something more
You want me to do
Shall I hand up
All of my secrets to you
Maybe then you'll see me too
Is there something more
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You got me on my knees
Saying please are you a tease
You change locks so I change keys
Giving always, giving how ya living it's a drain
Hard to see the light as anything but a train
Is passion out of fashion
Am I on the wrong track
Hard for me to take
But can you tell what I lack
Been the early bird but I gets no worm
Treat me like a germ
But I still stand firm
Chasing am I
Wasting all my time on the cause
Do you want a break
Or do you need a pause
Never knew no one like you
That is never impressed
Is it how I'm dressed, huh
Or am I just a pest
I think you bend me
Just to see if I will break
Evasion from the case
Just to see what I will take
Lead me, lead me on
Because you know I wanna swing
Question that I'm pressing
Is there anything
