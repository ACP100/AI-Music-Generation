Inside Out Lyrics
You turn me inside out
Turn me inside out
You tell me what it's all about
To make the tears run dry
You turn me inside out
And I don't have the slightest doubt
Cause I can see
Cause I can see
You can see
You can see
What's really inside of me
What's really inside of me
No doubt that I am open
In total disarray
Scary that I've found for what
I've been hoping
Yet I choose to play
The perals on the fantasy of bliss
Bores me to your presence
Silly to fear what I've missed
Forged into my essence
I'm inside out
You turn me inside out
Turn me inside out
You tell me what it's all about
To make the tears run dry
You turn me inside out
And I don't have the slightest doubt
