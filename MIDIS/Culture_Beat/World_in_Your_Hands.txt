World in Your Hands Lyrics
CHORUS:
You can walk on the water, shine like a diamond
Ring the bells of fortune if you dare
You can make any move that you wanna make
Take everything that you can if you dare
Just think the world is in your hands
Just think the world is in your hands
Think the world is in your hands
Just think the world is in your hands
RAP:
Stress on my mind, think I'll end it all, people tell me to stand tall
Ou can make any move that y nothing to give and I'm tired of hitting
Walls
They don't understand from where I come, my past not a pretty one
Scars, never stars, now I'm ready to quit and let this life be done
Some tell me to hold on, tell me to be strong, but the battle's too long
No fight left in me, but they don't comprehend that my will is all gone
Nothing to grasp, hope is past and my faith is in the trash
So save the love that you think I need, I'm going out with a blast
CHORUS:
You can walk on the water, shine like a diamond
Ring the bells of fortune if you dare
You can make any move that you wanna make
Take everything that you can if you dare
Just think the world is in your hands
Just think the world is in your hands
Think the world is in your hands
Just think the world is in your hands
RAP:
Troubles got me down, never got a break, just pain and heartache
Not looking for a reason to go on, no more, I've had all I can take
I'm tired of the same old thing, same old scene, death must now be king
I give up, I don't wanna live up to the wicked hopes of society
Some say excel, but I still fail so well, just call me a pro
Reasons for failing, truth be known, I really don't care to know
It's time to move on, time to be gone, farewell to my king
Just wanna end this losing trend with a bullet and a shot of gin
