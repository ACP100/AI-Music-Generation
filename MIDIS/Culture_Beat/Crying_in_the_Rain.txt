Crying In The Rain Lyrics
Stop, you breathe you lie
Loops got ya lost I can't hear ya
Treason took a try
Desperate drown in dirty things
Juvenile Jazz you hide
Can't loose no love from day I shared
Faint twinkle in your eyes
Weary from how you earn your things
You slip from sliding
Slowly, slither, sneaky
Simple for a snake
Poser in pursuit of passion
Can't rush my quiver fake a quake
Betrayer, disarrayer
Leave a soft one frying in the pain
Deceitful, full of that
Couldn't care less if you're crying in the rain
Stop that crying
Stop that lying
It's boring me
I don't wanna spend my time with you
Stop to think
That once you brought me to exctasy
I want the loving that I really need
