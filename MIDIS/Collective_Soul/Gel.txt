Gel Lyrics
Song was Featured in The Jerky Boys: The Movie
[Verse 1]
Color me any color
Speak to me in tongues and share
Tell me how you'd love to hate me
Tell me how you'd love to care
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I just want
(To shake us up)
Well, I just want, I just want to
To shake us up (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
[Chorus]
Let's mingle (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
And make it well (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
Come together now (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
Yeah, let's gel
[Verse 2]
Clothe me in any fashion
Glitter to so mundane
Tell me how you'd love to change me
Tell me I can stay the same
[Bridge]
Well, I just want
(To shake us up)
Well, I just want, I just want to
To shake us up (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
