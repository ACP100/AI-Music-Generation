Smashing Young Man Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Beggar's description
Of what I've been missing
Exploit your position
Don't think I didn't listen
Hey, I hope you're feeling
A little better now
[Verse 2]
Success is so tragic
Pain is your gadget
Your tongue's just lashing
Just bitching by habit
Hey, I hope you're feeling
A little purer now
Hey, I hope you're feeling
Securer now
[Chorus]
Help me, I plea
I don't understand
Your ways and means
You smashing young man
Help me to see
The good you have planned
You're wearing me thin
You smashing young man
