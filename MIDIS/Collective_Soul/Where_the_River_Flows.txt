Where the River Flows Lyrics
[Verse 1: Ed Roland]
Give me a moment
Got to get this weight up off my chest
Don't feed me sorrow
Pain is a poison I digest
[Chorus: Ed Roland, 
Will Turpin
]
Find yourself another soul to hold
You think, you thought, I know
Off upon my journey, I must go
To where the river flows
To where the river flows
[Verse 2: Ed Roland, 
Ed Roland & Will Turpin
]
I'll give you answers
To the questions you 
have yet to ask
Silence is beauty
Words, they only 
complicate the task
[Chorus: Ed Roland, 
Will Turpin
]
Find yourself another soul to hold
You think, you thought, I know
Off upon my journey, I must go
To where the river flows
To where the river flows
