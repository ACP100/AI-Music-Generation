Run Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Are these times contagious?
I've never been this bored before
Is this the prize I've waited for?
Now with the hours passing
There's nothing left here to insure
I long to find the messenger
[Chorus]
Have I got a long way to run?
Have I got a long way to run?
Yeah, I run
[Verse 2]
Is there a cure among us?
From this processed sanity?
I weaken with each voice that sings
Now in this world of purchase
I'm gonna buy back memories
To awaken some old qualities
[Chorus]
Have I got a long way to run?
Have I got a long way to run?
Yeah, I run
Yeah, I run
