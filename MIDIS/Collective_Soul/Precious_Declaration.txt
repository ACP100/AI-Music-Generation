Precious Declaration Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hitched a ride to the peaceful side of town
Then proceeded where thieves were no longer found
[Pre-Chorus]
Can't crash now
Well, I've been waiting for this
Won't crash now
I found some encouragement
[Chorus]
Precious declaration reads
Yours is yours and mine you leave alone now
Precious declaration says
I believe all hope is dead no longer
[Verse 2]
New meanings to the words I feed upon
Wake within my veins elements of freedom
[Pre-Chorus]
Can't break now
Well, I've been living for this
Won't break now
I'm cleansed with hopefulness
