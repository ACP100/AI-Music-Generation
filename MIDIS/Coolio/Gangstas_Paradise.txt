[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the streetlight
[Chorus: LV]
They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-four?
The way things is goin', I don't know
