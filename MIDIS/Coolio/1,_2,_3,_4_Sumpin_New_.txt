[Intro]
This is some of the lingua franca of the funk business
And people come from miles around
With  an almost religious devotion to get on down
[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta-gotta get up to get down
Gotta-gotta get up to get down
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta-gotta get up to get down
Gotta-gotta get up to get down
[Verse 1]
What up everybody, so glad you're here
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage, but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention
Now I wants to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk
When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C-
Double O-L-I-O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know
One, two, three, it's like A, B, C
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
Slide, slide, but that's that past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass
