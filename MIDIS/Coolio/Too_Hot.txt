'Cause he was rollin' on beads and had a good ass job
Rob slept with Lisa who slept with Steve and
Steve was positive, H.I.V
What started off as a plan ended up in the plot
Ya better cool ya ass off 'cause it's too damn hot

Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, homie (too hot)
Gotta make some sense, from this mess that we made
