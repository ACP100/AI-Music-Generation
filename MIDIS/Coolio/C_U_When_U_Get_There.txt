C U When U Get There Lyrics
The beat contains a sample of Canon in D by Johann Pachelbel.
[Verse 1: Coolio]
Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinking
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinking
And smoking, pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken
Let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy? 'Cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
'Cause my crew is rolling Hummers and your crew is rolling dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
Uh, I guess that's just the way it go
I ain't tryna preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there
[Chorus]
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
