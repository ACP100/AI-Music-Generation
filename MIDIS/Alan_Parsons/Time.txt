Time Lyrics
Time, flowing like a river
Time, beckoning me
Who knows when
We shall meet again, if ever
But time keeps flowing
Like a river to the sea
Goodbye my love
Maybe for forever
Goodbye my love
The tide waits for me
Who knows when
We shall meet again, if ever
But time keeps flowing
Like a river (on and on)
To the sea, to the sea
'Til it's gone forever
Gone forever
Gone forevermore
Goodbye my friend
(Goodbye my love)
Maybe for forever
Goodbye my friend
(Who knows when
We shall meet again)
The stars wait for me
Who knows where
We shall meet again, if ever
But time keeps flowing
Like a river (on and on)
To the sea, to the sea
