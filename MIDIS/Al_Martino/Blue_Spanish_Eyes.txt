Blue Spanish Eyes Lyrics
Blue Spanish eyes
Teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes
Please please don't cry
This is just adios and not good-bye
Soon I'II return, bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say. si si....
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Blue Spanish eyes
Prettiest eyes in all of Mexico
True Spanish eyes, please smile for me once more before I go
Soon I'II return, bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say: si si....
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
