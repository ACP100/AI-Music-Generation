Spanish Eyes Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Blue Spanish eyes
Teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes
Please, please don't cry
This is just adios and not goodbye
[Chorus]
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say "sí, sí"
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
[Verse 2]
Blue Spanish eyes
Prettiest eyes in all of Mexico
True Spanish eyes
Please smile for me once more before I go
[Chorus]
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say "sí, sí"
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
[Outro]
You and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
