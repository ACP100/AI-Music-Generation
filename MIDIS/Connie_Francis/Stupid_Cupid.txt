Stupid Cupid Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Stupid Cupid, you're a real mean guy (Stupid Cupid)
I'd like to clip your wings so you can't
 fly (Stupid Cupid)
I'm in love and it's a crying shame (Stupid Cupid)
And I know that you're the one to blame
[Chorus]
Hey hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid, stop picking on me
[Verse 2]
I can't do my homework and I can't think straight (Stupid Cupid)
I meet him every morning 'bout a half past eight (Stupid Cupid)
I'm acting like a lovesick fool (Stupid Cupid)
You've even got me carrying his books to school (Stupid Cupid)
[Chorus]
Hey hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid, stop picking on me
[Bridge]
You mixed me up for good right from the very start
Hey, go play, Robin Hood, with somebody else's heart
[Verse 3]
You've got me jumping like a crazy clown (Stupid Cupid)
And I don't feature what you're putting down (Stupid Cupid)
Since I kissed his loving lips of wine (Stupid Cupid)
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine (Stupid Cupid)
