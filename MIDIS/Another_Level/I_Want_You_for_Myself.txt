I Want You for Myself Lyrics
[Intro]
Oh
I want you, babe
Girl, you got me, think I want you all for my own
Girl, you got me, think I want you for my own
Girl, you got me, think I want you all for my own
Girl, you got me, think I want you for my own
[Chorus]
I want you for myself
I don't want nobody else
To try to intervene or come between
You and me
'Cause we've got a good thing, yeah
I want you for myself
I don't want nobody else
To try to intervene or come between
You and me
'Cause we got a good thing, baby
[Verse 1]
Why should I play the field when it's you that I want?
I'm not that jealous type, but I ain't gonna front
We should just settle down and stop foolin' around
'Cause we both feel for each other
So why should there be those other lovers?
