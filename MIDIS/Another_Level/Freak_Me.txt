Freak Me Lyrics
Freak me, baby
Freak me, baby
Freak me, baby
Freak me, baby
Let me lick you up and down till you say stop
Let me play with your body, baby, make you real hot
Let me do all the things you want me to do
Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you
Baby, don't you understand I wanna be your nasty man?
I wanna make your body scream, then you will know just what I mean
24 carat gold, don't want the night to grow cold
I wanna lick you up and down, then I wanna lay you down
Come on sexy
Let me lick you up and down till you say stop
Let me play with your body, baby, make you real hot
Let me do all the things you want me to do
Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you
I love the taste of whipped cream, spread it on the top of me
You know I can't resist you, girl, I'll fly you all around the world
I wanna see your body drip, come on let me take a sip
To calm what you cherish most cause we're not about to brag and boast
