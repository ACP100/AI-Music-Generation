When I See You Smile Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I wonder how I'd ever make it through
Through this world without havin' you
I just wouldn't have a clue
'Cause sometimes it seems 
like this world is closin' in on me
And there's no way of breakin' free
And then I see you reach for me
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna give up, wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you baby, and everything's alright
Everything's alright
[Chorus]
When I see you smile
I can face the world, oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile
See a ray of light, oh
See it shinin' right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby, when I see you smile at me
Oh yeah
[Verse 2]
Baby, there's nothin' in this world that could ever do
What a touch of your hand can do
It's like nothin' that I ever knew, hey
