Help Lyrics
[Skit]
One two three...
Wait wait wait, what's the first line again ?
Help !
Oh yeah
One two...
Help !
No wait !
Sorry
One two three four
[Intro]
(Help!) I need somebody
(Help!) Not just anybody
(Help!) You know I need someone
(Help!)
[Verse 1]
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
