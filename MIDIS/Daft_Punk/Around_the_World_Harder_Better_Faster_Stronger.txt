Around the World / Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger Lyrics
The Grammy award winning single from Daft Punkâ€™s Alive 2007 show.
Steam machine, steam machine, steam machine, steam machine
Steam machine, steam machine, steam machine, steam machine
Steam machine, steam machine, steam machine, steam machine
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Work it, make it, do it, makes us
Harder, better, faster, stronger
More than, hour, hour, never
Ever, after, work is, over
Work it, make it, do it, makes us
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Harder, better, faster, stronger
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
