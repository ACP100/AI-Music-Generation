Fantasy Lyrics
Every man has a place
In his heart, there's a space
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship, fantasize
All your dreams will come true right away
And we will live together
Until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever, as one
Every thought is a dream
Rushing by in a stream
Bringing life to the kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship, fantasize
All your dreams will come true miles away
Our voices will ring together
Until the twelfth of never
We all will live, love forever, as one
Come to see victory
In the land called fantasy
Loving life, a new degree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty
