Sunday Morning Lyrics
[Intro]
Yeah, oh yeah
[Chorus]
Ooh, Sunday morning
(Ba-ba-by, ba-ba-by, ya)
You're gonna find my love shinin' on you
(You're gonna find my love)
[Verse 1]
Ooh, I'm waiting
I'm forever anticipating
Your face on my pillow
You're the sunshine pourin' through my window
[Pre-Chorus]
And like the grapes on the vine
Love is sweeter with time
And you were made to love, yeah
[Chorus]
Ooh (Sunday morning, I'll be waiting)
Sunday morning (To your love I'm dedicated, yeah)
You're gonna find my love shinin' on you
(You're gonna find my love, yeah)
Ooh (Sunday morning, I'll be waiting)
Sunday morning (To your love I'm dedicated, yeah)
It's like the best of everything fallin' on you
(You're gonna find my love)
