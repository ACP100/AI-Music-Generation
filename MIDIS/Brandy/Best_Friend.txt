[Verse 1]
Whenever I'm down
I call on you, my friend
A helping hand you lend
In my time of need, so I
I'm calling you now
Just to make it through
What else can I do?
Don't you hear my plea?
[Pre-Chorus]
Friends may come and friends may go
But you should know that
That I've got your back, it's automatic
So, never hesitate to call
'Cause I'm your sister and always for ya
And I
[Chorus]
Don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning 'til the end (Ooh)
You've always been here right beside me (Hey, oh yeah)
So I'll call you my best friend (Ooh, oh yeah)
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes
And that's you as my best friend (Oh yeah)
