[Intro: Brandy & 
Monica
]
The boy is mine, the boy is mine, the boy is mine, the boy is mine, the boy is mine
Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
Uh-huh, sure
You know, you look kinda familiar
Yeah, you do too
But, um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named...? You, you know his name
Oh yeah, definitely, I know his name
But I just wanna let you know that he's mine
Haha, no, no, he's mine
[Chorus: Brandy]
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
[Verse 1: Brandy & 
Monica
]
I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
You see, I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
You see, I tried to hesitate
I didn't wanna say what he told me
He said without me, he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took
 (The boy is mine)
