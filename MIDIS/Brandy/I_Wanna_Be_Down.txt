The kind of girl that you could be down for

Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact, then I'll be more than you ever could dream of
If all you need is my time, that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you want me, baby
I wanna stay by your side, be there to cool you off
And let you know everything will be alright
