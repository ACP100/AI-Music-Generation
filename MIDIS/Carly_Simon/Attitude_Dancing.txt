Attitude Dancing Lyrics
(Carly Simon/Jacob Brackman)
There's a new kind of dancing
That's gonna be the rage
You just leave yourself behind
Like an actor on a stage
Cop a different pose
From the pose you're in
Shine a different attitude
From underneath your skin
Attitude dancing
Strut around the floor in a different attitide
Attitude dancing
Any attitude is the proper attitude
Attitude dancing
Don't be afraid to change your attitude
Attitude dancing
Free up your spirit with a new attitude
It don't even matter
If you stretch or shake
And it don't really matter
What moves your body makes
