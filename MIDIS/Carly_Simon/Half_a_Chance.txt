Half A Chance Lyrics
You said we'd light the firmament
You said our love was permanent
You said we'd stick through thick and thin
Through up and down, through lose and win
But comes the first sign of stormy weather
You're packin' your bags in the trance
But you gotta give
(Chorus)
Half a chance
Half a chance
Half a chance
To our romance
You can't pretend it's Camelot
Then start to run when things get hot
When love explodes there's always heat
There's always bitter with the sweet
There's always times when your legs feel broken
But you still don't drop out of the dance
You gotta give
Half a chance
Half a chance
Half a chance
To our romance
