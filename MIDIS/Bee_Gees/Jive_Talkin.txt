It's just your jive talkin', you're telling me lies, yeah
Jive talkin', you wear a disguise
Jive talkin', so misunderstood, yeah

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

With all your jive talkin', you're telling me lies, yeah
Jive talkin', you wear a disguise
Jive talkin', so misunderstood, yeah
Jive talkin', you just ain't no good
You know that love talkin' is all very fine, yeah
Jive talkin' just isn't a crime
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die
Then all that jive talkin' just gets in your eye, yeah (Woo)
