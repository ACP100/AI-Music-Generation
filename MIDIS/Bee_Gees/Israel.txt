Israel Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You've had your troubles Israel
I've seen them all
But you put the writing on the wall
Israel, Israel
[Verse 2]
You know I've seen you fall so many times
I've cried for you and that's a crime
Israel, Israel, Israel
[Chorus]
Where there's sand
Where there's beautiful sand
You know you got a kind of feeling
That's just grand
Take me into your arms
Let me be with you
Israel, Israel, Israel
[Verse 3]
I like the smiles up on your people's faces
They make you feel warm embraces
And I want that kind of smile
That kind of smile
Israel you make the whole world think about you
And if they don't they'll find a reason
To shout about Israel, Israel
