Too Much Heaven Lyrics
“Too Much Heaven”, written in 1978, is the second track of the Bee Gee’s fifteenth studio album Spirits Have Flown, which was released in October 1979.
[
Chorus
: Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb
[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Ooh, you and me, girl, got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Then my life, I can see beyond forever
Everything we are will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?
[Chorus: Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb
[Verse 3: Barry Gibb]
You and me, girl, got a highway to the sky
We can turn away
From the night and day
And the tears we had to cry
