Paying the Price of Love Lyrics
How did you find there was somebody
More than you want me
I never understood
Maybe I have never had you
I have been lonely for you lately
I can't wait another day
And when you let me get you close to me
You run and leave me
Paying the price of love
The start of my end over you
When you're doin' it for someone
Who'll never be free
Now is all there will ever be
No more to live without you
All the nights I dream about you
Deep in the dark of the night
I'm a man on a mission
But safer with you home
Never would I make you sorry
You are the only drug I crave
And I've been saving everyday
I held it all inside, I pray
You don't forget you got me
