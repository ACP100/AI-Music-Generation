I Started a Joke Lyrics
I Started a Joke retains elements of fantasy and profundity.
[Verse 1]
I started a joke
Which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see
That the joke was on me, oh no
[Verse 2]
I started to cry
Which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me
[Refrain]
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
[Verse 3]
'Til I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me
[Refrain]
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
