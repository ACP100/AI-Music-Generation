Nights on Broadway Lyrics
[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Here we are
In a room full of strangers
Standing in the dark
Where your eyes couldn't see me
[Pre-Chorus: Robin Gibb]
Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my loving you
I can't stay away
[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them "straight to the heart" songs
Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town
[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Now in my place
There are so many others
Standin' in the line
How long will they stand between us
