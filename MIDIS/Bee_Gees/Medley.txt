Holiday/I Canâ€™t See Nobody/I Started a Joke/Massachusetts Lyrics
Ooh you're a holiday, ev'ry day, such a holiday
Now it's my turn to say, and I say you're a holiday
It's something I think's worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones, throwing stones
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
If millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When that someone else is me
It's unkind, it's unkind
De de de de de    de de de de de de de
De de de de de de de de de de de
I walk the lonely streets
I watch the people passing by
I used to smile and say hello
I guess that I was just a happy guy
Then you happened, girl
This feeling that possesses me
I just can't move myself
I guess it all just had to be
