Blind Man Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I took a course in Hallelujah
I went to night school for de blues
I took some stuff they said would cool ya
But nothing seemed to light my fuse
But that's all in the past
Like a check that's in the mail
She was a tall whiskey glass
I was an old hound dog
That just loved to chase his tail
[Chorus]
Until I met a Blind Man
Who taught me how to see
A Blind Man
Who could change night into day
And if I can
I'm going to make you come with me
Because here come the sun
And we'll be chasing all the clouds away
[Verse 2]
I've had some lovers like a joyride
Some things are never what they seem
My heaven's turned into a landslide
Thank God I woke up from that dream
