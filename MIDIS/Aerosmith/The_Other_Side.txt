The Other Side Lyrics
[Intro]
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (Yeah!)
[Chorus]
Lovin' you has go to be (Take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (Take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (Take me to the other side)
Oh, take me to the other side (Take me to the other side)
[Verse 1]
My mama told me there'd be days like this
And, man, she wasn't foolin'
'Cause I just can't believe the way you kiss
Uh, uh-huh
You opened up your mouth with baited breath
You said you'd never leave me
You love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss
You're crying me a river, but I got to get across
[Chorus]
Lovin' you has go to be (Take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (Take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (Take me to the other side)
Oh, honey, take me to the other side (Take me to the other side)
