[Verse 1]
Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound of my gun
Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
[Chorus 1]
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do?

[Verse 2]

[Chorus 2]
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her

Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue

He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and
 the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain
