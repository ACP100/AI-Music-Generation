Helter Skelter Lyrics
[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Untill I get to the bottom
And I see you again...yeah yeah yeah yeah
[Chorus 1]
Do you, don't you
Want me to love you
I'm comin' down fast
But I'm miles above you
A tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover
But you ain't no dancer...yeah
[Chorus 2]
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter...ooohhh
[Verse 1]
Will you, won't you
Want me to make you
I'm coming down fast
But don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover
But you ain't no dancer...that's right
