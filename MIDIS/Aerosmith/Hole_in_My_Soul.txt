[Verse 1]
I'm down a one way street
With a one night stand
With a one track mind
Out in no man's land
The punishment sometimes
Don't seem to fit the crime
Yeah, there's a hole in my soul
But one thing I learned
For every love letter written
Is another one burned
So you tell me how it's gonna be this time
[Pre-Chorus]
Is it over?
Is it over?
'Cause I'm blowing out the flame
[Chorus]
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look, and you will find there's nothing there, girl
Yeah, I swear, I'm telling you, girl, yeah, 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where a garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, yeah, I should have known better
'Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose
Yeah, yeeeaaahhhh
