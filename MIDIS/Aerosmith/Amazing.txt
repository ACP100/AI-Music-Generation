Amazing Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and 
I hit the floor
Yeah, I 
thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die
[Chorus]
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
[Bridge]
That one last shot's a
 
permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings
