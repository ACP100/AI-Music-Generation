What It Takes Lyrics
[Intro]
Ooooh, yeah
[Verse 1]
There goes my old girlfriend
There's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises?
I guess they don't mean a thing
So, baby, what's the story?
Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
When you don't look back
I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah
[Chorus]
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go
