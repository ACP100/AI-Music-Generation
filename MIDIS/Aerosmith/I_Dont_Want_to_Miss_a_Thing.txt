[Verse 1]
I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'
While you're far away and dreamin'
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Well, every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure
[Chorus]
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
[Verse 2]
Lyin' close to you, feelin' your heart beatin'
And I'm wonderin' what you're dreamin'
Wonderin' if it's me you're seein'
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever
Forever and ever
