[Verse 1]
There was a time
When I was so broken-hearted
Luck wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah

Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me, yeah!
[Bridge]
Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same
