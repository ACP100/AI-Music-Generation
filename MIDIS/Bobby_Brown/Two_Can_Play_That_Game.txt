Two Can Play That Game Lyrics
“Two Can Play That Game” only peaked at #38 on the U.K. Singles chart in 1994.
[Intro]
Ya, ya, ya-ooh-ah-ooh-ah
Ya, ya, ya
Yo, yo, yo
Ya, ya, ya
Yo-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
[Chorus]
Two can play that game
Two can play that game
Two can play that game
Two can play that game
[Verse 1]
Stay with me but if you want to leave
Take your things, forget all about me
Tell me why you fail to realize
That you might not ever get another try
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, think
About it before you leave
Cause Bobby's got a brand new swing
And if you wanna do your own thing
I hear what you're sayin'
Two can play that game
