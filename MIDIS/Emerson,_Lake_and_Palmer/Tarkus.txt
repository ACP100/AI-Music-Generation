Tarkus Lyrics

II. Stones of Years 02:43-06:27

[Verse 1]
Has the dawn ever seen your eyes?
Have the days made you so unwise?
Realize, you are
[Verse 2]
Had you talked to the winds of time
Then you'd know how the waters rhyme
Taste of wine
[Verse 3]
How can you know where you've been?
In time, you'll see the sign
And realize your sin
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
[Instrumental Break 04:01-05:39]
[Keyboard Solo]
[Verse 4]
Will you know how the seed is sown?
All your time has been overgrown
Never known
