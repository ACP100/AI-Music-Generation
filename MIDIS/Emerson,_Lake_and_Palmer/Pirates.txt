Pirates Lyrics
"Who'll make his mark?" the captain cried
"To the devil drink a toast
We'll glut the hold with cups of gold
And we'll feed the sea with ghosts
I see your hunger for a fortune
Could be better served beneath my flag
If you've the stomach for a broadside
Come aboard my pretty boys
I will take you and make you
Everything you've ever dreamed
"Make fast the guns tonight we sail
When the high tide floods the bay
Cut free the lines and square the yards
Get the black flag stowed away
The Turk, the Arab, the Spaniard
Will soon have 
pennies on their eyes
And any other laden fancy
We will take her by surprise
I will take you and make you
Everything you've ever dreamed."
Six days off the Cuban coast when a sail ahead they spied
"A galleon of the treasure fleet,' the mizzen lookout cried
"Closer to the wind my boys," the mad-eyed captain roared
"For every man that's alive tonight will be hauling gold aboard."
"Spare us," the galleon begged, but mercy's face had fled
Blood ran from the screaming souls the cutlass harvested
Driven to the quarter deck the last survivor fell
"She's ours my boys," the captain grinned "and no one left to tell."
