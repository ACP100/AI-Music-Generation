The Endless Enigma Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Why do you stare?
Do you think that I care?
You've been misled
By the thoughts in your head
Your words waste and decay
Nothing you say
Reaches my ears anyway
You never spoke a word of truth
[Verse 2]
Why do you think
I believe what you said?
Few of your words
Ever enter my head
I'm tired of hypocrite freaks
With tongues in their cheeks
Turning their eyes as they speak
They make me sick and tired
