Take a Pebble Lyrics
[Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:44]
[Verse 1]
Just take a pebble and cast it to the sea
Then watch the ripples that unfold into me
My face spills so gently into your eyes
Disturbing the waters of our lives
[Verse 2]
Shreds of our memories are lying on your grass
Wounded words of laughter are graveyards of the past
Photographs are grey and torn, scattered in your fields
Letters of your memories are not real
[Instrumental Break 02:26-11:21]
[Verse 3]
Wear sadness on your shoulders like a worn-out overcoat
In pockets creased and tattered hang the rags of your hopes
The daybreak is your midnight, the colours have all died
Disturbing the waters of our lives
[Outro]
Of our lives, lives, lives
Of our lives
