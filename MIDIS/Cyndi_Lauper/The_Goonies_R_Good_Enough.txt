The Goonies ‘R’ Good Enough Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Here we are, hanging onto strains of greed and blues
Break the chain, then we break down
Oh, it's not real if you don't feel it
[Pre-Chorus]
Unspoken expectations
Ideals you used to play with
They've finally taken shape
[Chorus]
What's good enough (Good enough)
For you, it's good enough (Good enough)
For me, it's good enough (Good enough)
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Now you'll say you're startin' to feel the push and pull
Of what could be and never can
You mirror me, stumblin' through those
[Pre-Chorus]
Old fashioned superstitions
I find it too hard to break
Oh, maybe you're out of place
