Whatâ€™s Going On Lyrics
[Intro]
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
And brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know you've got to find a way
To bring back love here today
[Verse 1]
Father, father
There's no need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring back lovin' here today
[Pre-Chorus]
Picket lines (Brother)
And picket signs (Brother)
Don't punish me (Brother)
With brutality (Brother)
Just talk to me (Brother)
So you can see
[Chorus]
Ah, what's going on
What's going on
What's going on, yeah
What's going on
