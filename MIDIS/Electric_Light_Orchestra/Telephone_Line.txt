Telephone Line Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hello, how are you?
Have you been alright
Through all those lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights?
That's what I'd say
I'd tell you everything
If you'd pick up that telephone
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Hey, how you feelin'?
Are you still the same?
Don't you realise the things we did, we did
Were all for real, not a dream?
I just can't believe
They've all faded out of view
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
Doo-wop, doo-be-doo-doo-wop, doo-wah, doo-lang
Blue days, black nights
, doo-wah, doo-lang
I look into the sky
(The love you need ain't gonna see you through)
And I wonder why
(The little things you planned ain't coming true)
