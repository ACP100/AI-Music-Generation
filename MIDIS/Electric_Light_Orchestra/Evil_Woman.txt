Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame

But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
You found a fool lyin' in a daze
Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do?
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
It's so good that you're feeling pain
But you better get your face on board the very next train
(
Hey, hey-hey-hey
