Weâ€™re In This Love Together Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's like a diamond ring, it's a precious thing
And we never want to lose it
It's like a favorite song that we love to sing
Every time we hear the music
[Chorus]
And we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time
[Verse 2]
It's like a rainy night under candlelight
And, ooh it's so romantic
We got the whole thing working out so right
And it's just the way we planned it
[Chorus]
Tell ya we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
Don't you know we're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time
