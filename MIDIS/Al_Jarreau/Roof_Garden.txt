Roof Garden Lyrics
[Intro]
Oh, yeah!
That's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, baby
Come on!
What your mama gonna say when she finds that you party like this, girl?
[Chorus]
Does anyone wanna go waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone wanna go dance up on the roof?
Does anyone wanna go waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone wanna go dance up on the roof?
[Verse 1]
On the town
Sequins, evening gown
Climb those stairs
To that ballroom in the air
Get to poppin'!
[Chorus]
Does anyone wanna go waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone wanna go dance up on the roof?
(Come along! Get it on!)
Does anyone wanna go waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone wanna go dance up on the roof?
