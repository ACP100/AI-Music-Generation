Moonlighting (Theme) Lyrics
[Intro]
Mmm, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Don't you change
[Verse 1]
Some walk by night
Some fly by day
Nothing could change you
Set and sure of the way
Charming and bright
Laughing and gay
I'm just a stranger
Love the blues and the Braves
[Bridge]
There is the sun and moon
They sing their own sweet tune
Watch them when dawn is due
Sharing one space
[Verse 2]
Some walk by night
Some fly by day
Something is sweeter
When you meet 'long the way
