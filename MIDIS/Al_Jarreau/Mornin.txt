Morninâ€™ Lyrics
[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Mornin' Mister Radio
Mornin' little Cheerios
Mornin' sister oriole
Did I tell you everything is fine
In my mind?
[Verse 2]
Mornin' Mister Shoeshine man
Shine 'em bright in white and tan
My baby said she loves me and
Need I tell you that everything here is just fine
In my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
'Scuse me if I sing
My heart has found its wings
Searchin' high and low
And now, at last, I know
[Verse 3]
Mornin' Mister Golden Gate
I should walk but I can't wait
I can't wait to set it straight
I was shakin' but now, I am makin' it fine
Here in my mind
