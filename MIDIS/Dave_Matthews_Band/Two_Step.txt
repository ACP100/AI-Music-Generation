Two Step Lyrics
[Verse 1]

You laid down to give to me just what I'm seeking
Say love, you drive me to distraction
[Verse 2]
Oh my love do you believe that we might last

To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot change
(Change)
(Why would I want to change it?)
(Change)

Grown tired of water all the time
You quench my heart and, oh, you
Quench my mind and say
