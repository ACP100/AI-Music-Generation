One Sweet World Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nine planets around the sun
Only one does the sun embrace
Upon this watered one
So much we take for granted
[Chorus]
So let us sleep outside tonight
Lay down in our mother's arms
For here we can rest safely
[Verse 2]
If green should turn to grey
Would our hearts still bloody beat?
If the mountains tumble away, the river dry
Would it stop the stepping feet?
[Chorus]
So let us sleep outside tonight
Lay down in our mother's arms
For here we can rest safely
[Bridge 1]
Take all that we can get
When it's done
Nobody left to bury here
Nobody left to dig the holes
And here we can rest safely
