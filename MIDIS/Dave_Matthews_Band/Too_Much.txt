Too Much Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Ooh, straight in, suck up and go
Cool it, swallow, swallow
Bow, breathe deep, take it all
It comes cheap
Push it through the doors
Cause in between the lines
I'm gonna pack more lines
So I get down in
Ooh traffic jam got more cars
Than a beach got sand
Suck it up suck it up suck it up
Fill it up until no more
I'm no crazy creep, I've got it coming
To me because I'm not satisfied
The hunger keeps on growing
[Chorus]
I eat too much
I drink too much
I want too much
Too much
[Verse 2]
I've got to get it somewhere
I mean, you never know, maybe
You're dreaming
Who do you think you're watching?
Who do you think you need?
Play for me, play more
Ten times in the same day
I need more
I'm going, over my borders
I'm going to take more
More from you, letter by letter
