Halloween Lyrics
An angry, embittered reaction to being rejected after proposing marriage, possibly by the same woman who inspired the tender, gentle Iâ€™ll Back You Up.
[Verse 1]
Hey little dreamer's eyes open and staring up at me
Oh little lonely eyes open and radiant
Wait until I come and I will steal you
Wait until I come I'll take your soul
Wait until I come and I will steal you
Wait until I come and I won't go
Darling dreaming in the night
Shadows on the windows
Lead oh and everyone go
Well leave me on the night
I will give you lightning
I will not relinquish light
Oh little dreamer eyes open and raving here
Wait until I come and see you, little girl
When we come I'll leave with you too
When we come I'll let you come low
Hey we'll leave it all behind
Oh and then the nightmares
I'll fill them in good time
Oh they will seat your mind
When the light hits
And you maybe'll ask me
Why do you run around here?
Why do you come inside of me?
Why does it rip me out in dream?
Why then why then watch this little fuck
Going away
