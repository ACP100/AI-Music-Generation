Slow Ride Lyrics
The song samples “Low Rider” by War.
[Produced by Rick Rubin and Beastie Boys]
[Verse 1]
They got a committee to get me off the block
'Cause I say my rhymes loud, and I say 'em nonstop
Because bein' bad news is what we're all about
We went to White Castle, and we got thrown out
I got my boy Mike D, I got the King Ad-Rock
I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock
I shot homeboy, but the bullet was a dud
So I reached in the Miller cooler, grabbed a cool Bud
[Verse 2]
Slow ridin', gun hidin', on the go
I'm fly like an eagle, and I drink Old Crow
I'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back
My teacher had beef, so I gave her a smack
She chased me out of class, she was strapped with a ruler
Went to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler
With bottle in hand, at the microphone stand
Ay, yo, homeboy, what you drinkin', man?
[Bridge]
I got money, I got juice
I got to the party and I got loose
I got rhythms, I got rhymes
I got the girlies with the def behinds
I got ill, I got busted
I got dust and I got dusted
I got gold, I got funky
I got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey
