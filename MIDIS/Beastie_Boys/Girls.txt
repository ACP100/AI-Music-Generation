[Intro]
Girls!
All I really want is (Girls!)
And in the morning it's (Girls!)
'Cause in the evening it's (Girls!)
[Verse 1]
I like the way that they walk
And it's chill to hear them talk
And I can always make 'em smile
From White Castle to the Nile
[Verse 2]
Back in the day (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
There was this girl around the way (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
She liked my home-piece MCA (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
He said he would not give her play (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I asked him, "Please?"; he said, "You may" (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
Her pants were tight, and that's ok (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
If she would dance, I would DJ (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
We took a walk down to the bay
[Verse 3]
I hope she'll say (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
"Hey, me and you should hit the hay!" (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I asked her out, she said, "No way!"(bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I should've probably guessed her gay
 (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
So I broke north with no delay (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I heard she moved real far away (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
That was two years ago this May (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I seen her just the other day
