Come to Mama Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If the sun goes behind the clouds
And you feel it's gonna rain
If the moon ain't shinin' bright
And the stars, the stars won't shine for you tonight
[Chorus 1]
If life gets hard to understand
Your love life is out of hand
Just come to mama
Come on to mama
[Verse 2]
If you need a satisfier
Let me be, let me be, let me be your pacifier
If you feel like a horse brazin' at the bits
Call my number 568-6969, I'll give you a fix
[Chorus 2]
'Cause I got your favorite toy
Guaranteed to bring you joy
Just come to mama
Come on to mama
[Chorus 3]
If your soul is on fire
Let me take you to my only hearts desire
Just come to mama
Come on to mama
Just come to mama
Come on to mama
