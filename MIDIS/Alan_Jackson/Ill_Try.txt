Iâ€™ll Try Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Here we are, talking 'bout forever
Both know damn well it's not easy together
We've both felt love, we've both felt pain
I'll take the sunshine over the rain
[Chorus]
And I'll try, to love only you
And I'll try, my best to be true
Oh darling, I'll try
[Verse 2]
So I'm not scared, it's worth a chance to me
Take my hand, let's face eternity
Well I can't tell you that I'll never change
But I can swear that in every way
[Chorus]
I'll try, to love only you
And I'll try, my best to be true
Oh darling, I'll try
[Bridge]
I'm not perfect, just another man
But I will give you all that I am
