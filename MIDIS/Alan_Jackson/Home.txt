[Verse 1]
In small town down in Georgia, over forty years ago
Her maiden name was Musick 'til she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then, not a penny to their name
But they believed the one you vowed to love should always stay the same
[Verse 2]
And on the land his daddy gave him, a foundation underway
For a love to last forever, or until their dying days
They built a bond that's strong enough to stand the test of time
And a place for us to turn to when our lives were in a bind
[Chorus]
And they made their house from a tool shed
Granddaddy rolled down on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And they taught us about good living
They taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home
[Verse 3]
My mama raised five children, four girls and there was me
She found her strength and faith in God and a love of family
She never had a social life, home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job to pay a bill or two
