Tall, Tall Trees Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If you want to drive a big limousine
I'll buy the longest one you've ever seen
I'll buy you tall, tall trees
And all the waters in the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you
[Verse 2]
If you want to own a great big mansion
Well I'll give it my utmost attention
I'll buy you tall, tall trees
And all the waters in the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you
[Chorus]
Well, I'm a fool, a fool for you
It may take awhile, but I'll prove it's true
Well, if it's loving you want, well I've got it
If it's money you want, then I'll get it
I'll buy you tall, tall trees
And all the waters in the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you (Yahee) (Woo)
[Verse 3]
If you want to take a trip across the ocean
I'll travel anywhere you take a notion
I'll buy you tall, tall trees
And all the waters in the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you
