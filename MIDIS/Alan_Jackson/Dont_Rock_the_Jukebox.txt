Donâ€™t Rock the Jukebox Lyrics
[Chorus]
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rocking
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
[Verse 1]
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heart-broke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request
[Chorus]
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rocking
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
