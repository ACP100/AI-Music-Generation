Who’s Cheatin’ Who Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Everywhere you look, you can write a book
On the trouble with a woman and a man
But you can not impose, you can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand
[Chorus]
But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And whose car is parked next door
[Verse 2]
I thought I knew her well, I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right when she held me tight
How could I be so blind?
[Chorus]
But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
Whose car is parked next door
