[Verse 1]
Well I'm a-gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar
Every time I call my baby, to try to get a date
My boss says, "No dice, son, you gotta work late"
[Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
[Verse 2]

If you wanna use the car to go ridin' next Sunday"
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
"Now you can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick"
[Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
[Verse 3]
I'm gonna take two weeks, gonna have a vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nation
Well I called my congressman and he said quote
"I'd like to help you son, but you're too young to vote"
