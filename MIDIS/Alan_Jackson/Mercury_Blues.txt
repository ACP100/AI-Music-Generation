Mercury Blues Lyrics
Well if I had money
I'd tell you what I'd do
I go downtown buy a Mercury or two
Crazy about a Mercury
Lord I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury
I'm going to buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
Well the girl I love
I stole her from a friend
He got lucky stole her back again
She heard he had a Mercury
Lord she's crazy 'bout a Mercury
I'm going to buy me a Mercury & cruise it up & down the road
Hey now mama
You look so fine
Driven around in your Mercury 49'
Crazy about a Mercury
Lord I'm crazy bout a Mercury
I'm going to buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
Well my baby went out
She didn't stay long
Bought herself a Mercury, come a cruising home
She's crazy about a Mercury
Yeah she's crazy about a Mercury
I'm going to buy me a Mercury and cruise it up and down the road
