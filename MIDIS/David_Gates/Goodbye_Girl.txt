Goodbye Girl Lyrics
Gates' biggest solo hit was released to accompany the 1977 romantic comedy entitled The Goodbye Girl but is now better remembered than the film. The song peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
[Verse 1]
All your life you've waited
For love to come and stay
And now that I have found you
You must not slip away
I know it's hard believing
The words you've heard before
But darlin', you must trust them
Just once more
[Chorus]
'Cause baby, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together again
If you wake up and I'm not there, I won't be long away
'Cause the things you do, my goodbye girl, will bring me back to you
[Verse 2]
I know you've been taken
Afraid to hurt again
You fight the love you feel for me
Instead of giving in
But I can wait forever
A helping you to see
That I was meant for you
And you for me
