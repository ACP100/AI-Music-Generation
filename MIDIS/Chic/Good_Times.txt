Good Times Lyrics
[Chorus]
Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times
Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times
[Verse 1]
Happy days are here again
The time is right for makin' friends
Let's get together, how 'bout a quarter to ten?
Come tomorrow, let's all do it again
Boys will be boys, better let them have their toys
Girls will be girls, cute ponytails and curls
Must put an end to this stress and strife
I think I want to live the sporting life
[Chorus]
Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times
Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times
