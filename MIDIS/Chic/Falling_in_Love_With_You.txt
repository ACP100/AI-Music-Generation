Falling in Love with You Lyrics
I think of you, honey, night and day
And it's your sweet lovin'
That makes me feel this way
I'm not ashamed, oh no not me
Everyone should know
This is how love should be
And now that I've given you my heart
Please be gentle, baby
When the lovin' starts, cause
Falling in love with you
It's all I want to do
Falling in love with you tonight
Falling in love with you
It's all I want do
Tonight, tonight
I see your picture
I hear your name
I try to hide it, baby
But the feeling's still the same
