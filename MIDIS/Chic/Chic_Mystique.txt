Chic Mystique Lyrics
Hit it!
Hit it!
Hit it!
Hit it!
Chic (Chic)
Mystique (Mystique)
Sweet (Sweet)
Release (Release)
Get down and get up, groove me, work me
That's the move, sure can't hurt this beat
Forget your problems, groove will solve them
D-A-N-C-E with me
The Chic Mystique, a force that's driving
There is no surviving
The base and rhythm makes you move
Get into the Chic Groove
Chic (Chic)
Mystique (Mystique)
Sweet (Sweet)
Release (Release)
Come on, let's go, grab me, turn me
You got the moves, so smooth, body heat
Digging your style, so penetrating
Oooh, captivating me
