Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp) Lyrics
A novelty song in which Mann wants to thank the guy who invented doo wop, for it helped him find love.
I'd like to thank the guy
Who wrote the song
That made my baby
Fall in love with me
Who put the bomp
In the bomp bah bomp bah bomp?
Who put the ram
In the rama lama ding dong
?
Who put the bop
In the bop shoo bop shoo bop?
Who put the dip
In the dip da dip da dip?
Who was that man?
I'd like to shake his hand
He made my baby
Fall in love with me (yeah!!)
When my baby heard
"Bomp bah bah bomp "
"Bah bomp bah bomp bah bomp bomp"
Every word went right into her heart
And when she heard them singin'
"Rama lama lama lama"
"Rama lama ding dong"
She said we'd never have to part
So
