Da be da be da di da en da
Da be da be da di da en da
Da be da be da di da en da
[Chorus]
This is your night
Dancing free until the morning light
Together forever 'cause this is your night

It's too good to be true

This is your night
Dancing free until the morning light
Together forever 'cause this is your night
And everything is gonna be alright
Oh yeah
So in love with you
Oh yeah
It's too good to be true
Oh yeah
Feeling so brand new
Oh yeah
