Hello Africa Lyrics
Yo! My name is Dr. Alban, the MD, microphone doctor
This song is dedicated to the people of Africa
Swe Mix gimme some drums
Yo! African people, unite
Come together for the sake of your future
Yo! African people unite
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Nigeria! That's my Motherland
Coming to Sweden now causin' a hysteria
Takes a long time to travel the globe, so why be shy?
Why be humble? I just came straight out the jungle
You can't compete with me 'cause you know I got the rhythm
I did it before and I'll do it again, so listen watcha say
Yeah hear my point of view, not everyone can do this
In fact only a few sophisticated, hardcreated
That's who I am, and you knowI've been waiting
So start pumping make some noise
