Sing Hallelujah! Lyrics
[Intro]
Sing Hallelujah!
[Verse 1]
A B C is like 1 2 3
The beat, the rhythm, the bass y'all
Come on
Happy people come on
Jam with me, oh Lord
Come on, come on
Happy people, singing people
Party people, happy people
Jamming on the party session, oh Lord
[Chorus]
Sing Hallelujah, sing it
Sing Hallelujah, sing it, yeah
Sing Hallelujah, sing Hallelujah, sing it
Sing Hallelujah, sing it, yeah
Sing Hallelujah, sing Hallelujah
Ahh-yeah!
Sing Hallelujah, sing it
Sing Hallelujah, sing it
[Verse 2]
D E F like 4 5 6
One more time I say y'all
Come on
Party people come on
Sing with me, oh Lord
Come on, come on
The bubbling styles is wicked and wild
Wicked and wild, oh Lord
Mmh
