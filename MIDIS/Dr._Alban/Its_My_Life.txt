Itâ€™s My Life Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's my life take it or leave it
Set me free what's that crap papa-knew-it-all
I got my own life you got your own life
Live your life and set me free
Mind your business and leave my business
You know everything papa-knew-it-all
Very little knowledge is dangerous
Stop bugging me stop bothering me
Stop bugging me stop forcing me
Stop fighting me stop yelling me
It's my life
[Hook]
(It's my life)
It's my life my worries! (It's my life)
It's my life my problems! (It's my life)
It's my life my worries! (It's my life)
It's my life my problems! (It's my life)
[Verse 2]
Do you understand
I live the way I want to live
I make decisions day and night
Show me signs and good examples
Stop telling me how to run your business
Take a trip to east and west
You find that you don't know anything
Every's getting tired of you
Sometimes you have to look and listen
You can even learn from me
Little knowledge is dangerous
It's my life
