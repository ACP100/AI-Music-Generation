[Verse 1]
I've got a song
I ain't got no melody
I'ma gonna sing it to my friends
I've got a song
I ain't got no melody
I' ma gonna sing it to my friends
[Chorus]
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
[Verse 2]
I've got a story
Ain't got no moral
Let the bad guy win every once in a while
I've got a story
Ain't got no moral
Let the bad guy win every once in a while
[Chorus]
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
