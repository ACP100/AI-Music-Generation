You Are So Beautiful Lyrics
You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful to me
Can't you see?
You're everything that I hoped for and what's more
You're everything I need
You are so beautiful, baby, to me
You're everything that I hoped for and what's more
You're everything I need
You are so beautiful, baby, to me
Such joy and happiness you bring
I want to thank you, baby
Such joy and happiness you bring
Just like a dream
Your light of guiding lights shining in the night
You're Heaven's gift to me, hey, hey
You are so beautiful (You're beautiful, baby)
You are so beautiful (Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes)
You are so beautiful (And your smile, your smile)
You are so beautiful (Your attitude)
You are so beautiful (I can't help but love you, yeah)
You are so beautiful (Woah, you're beautiful, baby)
You are so beautiful (Your legs, your legs, your legs)
You are so beautiful (Your eyes, your eyes, you're beautiful, baby)
You are so beautiful (Your lips, your lips, your sweet lips, baby)
You are so beautiful (I love you, I love you, baby)
You are so beautiful (Mhm, you're the joy of my life, girl)
You are so beautiful (Thank you baby, for being so beautiful)
You are so beautiful (I just wanna thank you, baby, yeah)
You are so beautiful (For being beautiful to me, girl, yeah)
You are so beautiful (I just love you for that, baby, I love you for that, baby)
