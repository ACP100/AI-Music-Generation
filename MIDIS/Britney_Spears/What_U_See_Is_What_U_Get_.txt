What U See (Is What U Get) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You used to say that I was special
Everything was right
But now you think I'm wearing too much make-up
That my dress is too tight
You got no reasons to be jealous
I've never been untrue
So does it really matter if they're looking?
I'm only looking at you
[Pre-Chorus]
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am
[Chorus]
What you see is what you get
This is me, hey, you
If you want me, don't forget
You should take me as I am
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get
[Verse 2]
I know you watch me when I'm dancing
When I party with my friends
I can feel your eyes on my back, baby (Ah, na na)
I can't have no chains around me, baby, can't you see?
I could be anything you dream of, but I gotta feel free
