[Intro]
For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand
I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time
It's over now
[Verse 1]
I spotted you dancing, you made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes (
Ooh
), and the sexy hair
I shake, shake my thing, and make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back, I wanna see what you can do
[Pre-Chorus]
What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryna sound conceited, but me and you were meant to be
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (
Don't you know?
)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world
[Chorus]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (
You know I need you
)
Boys, to love her and to hold (
I just want you to touch me
)
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control
[Verse 2]
Took the boy off the dance floor, screaming in his ear
Must've said something 'bout me 'cause he's looking over here (
What you say?
)
You looking at me with that sexy attitude
But the way your boy's moving it, it puts me in the mood (
Ow!
)
