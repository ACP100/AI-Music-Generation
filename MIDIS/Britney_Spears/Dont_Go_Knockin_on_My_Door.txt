Don’t Go Knockin’ on My Door Lyrics
“Don’t Go Knockin' on My Door” is a song recorded by Britney Spears for her second studio album, Oops!…I Did It Again.
[Intro]
Don't go knock my door
Don't go knock my door
[Verse 1]
Time is up, no more cheat and lie
No more tears to dry
You and I, we're like so 
"bye-bye"
Finally, I am over you
Totally unblue
[Pre-Chorus]
When I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever
 and I
I'm telling you now
[Chorus]
Don't go knocking on my door
Gotta stay away, for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buying that
You better get off my back
Don't go knocking on my door
[Verse 2]
I can see, it's no mystery
It's so clear to me, what we had is all history
It's okay, I can sleep at night
It will be alright
