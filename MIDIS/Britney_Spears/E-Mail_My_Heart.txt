E-Mail My Heart Lyrics
“Email My Heart” is a song recorded by Britney Spears for her debut studio album, …Baby One More Time.
[Intro]
Forever
[Verse 1]
It's been hours, seems like days
Since you went away
And all I do is check the screen
To see if you're okay
You don't answer when I phone
Guess you wanna be left alone
So I'm sending you my heart, my soul
And this is what I'll say
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, oh-so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to you?
[Chorus]
Email my heart and say our love will never die
And I (I know), I know you're out there
And I know that you still care (I know you care)
Email me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever, yeah
Email my heart, woah
