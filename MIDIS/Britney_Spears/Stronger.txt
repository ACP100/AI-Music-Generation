[Intro]
Ooh, hey, yeah
[Verse 1]
Hush, just stop
There's nothing you can do or say (Baby)
I've had enough
I'm not your property as from today (Baby)
[Pre-Chorus]

Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I, I'm stronger
[Verse 2]

I used to go with the flow
Didn't really care 'bout me
[Pre-Chorus]
You might think that I can't take it
But you're wrong
