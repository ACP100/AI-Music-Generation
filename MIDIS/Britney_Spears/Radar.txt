[Verse 1]
Confidence is a must
Cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges, I like 'em rough
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a lush
Stop, you're making me blush
People are looking at us
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (Know)
[Chorus]
I'm checking you're so hot, so hot
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (On my radar)
On my radar (On my radar)
And yep, I notice you
I know it's you I'm choosing
Don't wanna lose you, you're on my radar (On my radar)
On my radar (On my radar)
And when you walk (When you walk)
And when you talk (When you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle
That's what I want (That's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
Tryna make you understand you're on my radar (On my radar)
On my radar (On my radar)
