[Intro]
I need time, love, joy
I need space, love
I need... me
(Action!)
[Verse 1]
Say hello to the girl that I am

I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't wanna be so damn protected
[Pre-Chorus]
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers
[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected
[Verse 2]
I'll tell 'em what I like, what I want, and what I don't
But every time I do, I stand corrected
Things that I've been told, I can't believe what I hear about the world
I realize I'm overprotected
