Soda Pop Lyrics
“Soda Pop” is a song recorded by Britney Spears for her debut studio album, …Baby One More Time.
[Intro: Britney Spears]
Oh-oh, a-here we go now, oh
[Verse 1: Mikey Bassie & 
Britney Spears
]
Like the great poet Homer, Agamemnon, or even Zeus
We takin' a vibical expedition, this pop ditty we choose
So be calm, don't ring the alarm, you see
'Cause we go on and on, come-come-come follow me, Britney (
Yeah
)
[Chorus: Mikey Bassie, 
Britney Spears
, 
Mikey & Britney
]
Open a soda pop, watch it fizz and pop
The clock is ticking and we can't stop (
Can't stop now
)
Open a soda pop, 
bop, shi-bop, shi-bop
The clock is ticking and we can't stop
[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
We're monster riding to the music tonight
A clever way to get by, oh (Mm)
The pop-speak flowing like it's fire and ice (Mm)
So give it a little bly, so
[Chorus: Mikey Bassie, 
Britney Spears
, 
Mikey & Britney
]
Open a soda pop, watch it fizz and pop (
Mm
)
The clock is ticking 
and we can't stop
, 
no
Open a soda pop, 
bop, shi-bop, shi-bop
The clock is ticking and we can't stop (
Ooh, ooh
)
