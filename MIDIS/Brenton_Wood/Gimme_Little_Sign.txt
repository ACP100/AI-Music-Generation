If you don't want me, don't lead me on, girl
But if you need me, show me that you love me

You'll be there when I look around
[Chorus]
Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my baby
To show me that you're mine, girl, all right
Just gimme some kind of sign, girl
, oh, my baby
To show me that you're mine, girl, all right, huh!
