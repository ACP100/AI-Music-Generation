Time What Is Time Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When the moonchild is crying
And silence has broken
The darkest truth
The things she remembered
Had never been her own
Replicant or human
I know the way to show
[Pre-Chorus 1]
What do I see
What will I find
Know the answer inside
It's your last step
[Chorus]
Time, what is time?
I wish I knew how to tell you why
It hurts to know
Aren't we machines
Time, what is time?
Unlock the door
And see the truth
Then time is time again
[Verse 2]
Whispering, these dreams were never mine
It's cold inside
It's gone forever, the things he saw
Who can say what's wrong or right
The vision of a free life
His eyes had seen it all
For what he's asking
The vision, vision, vision
I know it's all a lie
