My girl Lollipop, you make my heart go giddy up
You are as sweet as candy, you are my sugar dandy
Oh, oh, my girl lollipop, never ever leave me

My girl Lollipop, you make my heart go giddy up

Eh, My girl Lollipop
I love you, I love you, I love you so
And I don't want you to know
I need you, I need you, I need you so
But I'll never let you go
