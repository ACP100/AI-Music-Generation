Baby I Love You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Have I ever told you
How good it feels to hold you?
It isn't easy to explain
[Verse 2]
(Ooh) And though I'm really trying
(Ooh) I think I may start crying
(Ooh) My heart can't wait another day
(Ooh) When you touch me, I just got to say
[Chorus]
Baby, I love you (Ooh)
Baby, I love you (Ooh)
Baby, I love you (Ooh)
Come on baby, na-na-na-na-na-na
(Na-na-na-na-na-na)
[Verse 3]
(Ooh) I can't live without you
(Ooh) I love everything about you
(Ooh) I can't help it if I feel this way (Ooh)
[Verse 4]
(Ahh) Oh, I'm so glad I found you
(Ahh) I want my arms around you
(Ahh) I love to hear you call my name
(Ahh) Tell me, baby, that you feel the same
