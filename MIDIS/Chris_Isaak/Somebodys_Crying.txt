Somebodyâ€™s Crying Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I know somebody and they cry for you
They lie awake at night and dream of you
I bet you never even know they do, but
Somebody's crying
[Verse 2]
I know somebody and they called your name
A million times and still you never came
They go on loving you just the same
I know that somebody's trying
[Chorus]
So please return the love you took from me
Or please let me know if it can't be me
I know when somebody's lying
I know when somebody's lying
[Bridge]
I know that somebody's lying
I know that somebody's lying
[Verse 2]
Give me a sign and let me know if we're through
If you don't love me like I love you
But if you cry at night the way I do
I'll know that somebody's lying
