Blue Hotel Lyrics
[Intro]
Blue hotel
On a lonely highway
Blue hotel
Life don't work out my way
[Verse 1]
Blue hotel
On a lonely highway
Blue hotel
Life don't work out my way
[Pre-Hook 1]
I wait alone each lonely night
[Hook]
Blue hotel
Blue hotel
[Verse 2]
Blue hotel
Every room is lonely
Blue hotel
I was waiting only
[Pre-Hook 2]
The night and the life of her lonely dream
