This World Today Is A Mess Lyrics
[Verse 1]
What you do, what you say
Has a lot to do in how you live today
What you want, and what you make
Everybody knows it's only what you take
What you see and what you hear
When it comes around, again it's not too clear
You say yes, they say no
Everybody's talking everywhere you go
[Chorus]
You try to give another man a helping hand
He will take your kindness for a weaker stand
Never do to others what they do to you
Try to find another way to make it through
[Verse 2]
What I say is what I know
Try to get a favour going from door to door
You stop and pray, it's out of style
You a step ahead it takes a hundred miles
What I say is what I know
Try to get a favour going from door to door
You stop and pray, you know that's out of style
Get a step ahead it takes a hundred miles
