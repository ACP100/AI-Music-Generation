500 Miles High Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Someday, you'll look into her eyes
Then there'll be no goodbyes
And yesterday will have gone
And you'll find yourself in another space
Five hundred miles high
[Verse 2]
You'll see, just one look and you'll know
She's so tender and warm
You'll recognize this is love
You'll find yourself on another plane
Five hundred miles high
[Verse 3]
Be sure that your love stays so free
That it never can die
You realize this is truth
And above the skies you will always stay
Five hundred miles high
[Saxophone, Electric Piano, and Bass Solos]
[Verse 1]
Someday, you'll look into her eyes
Then there'll be no goodbyes
And yesterday will have gone
You'll find yourself in another space
Five hundred miles high
