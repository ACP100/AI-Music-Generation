Sometime Ago Lyrics
[Chorus]
Sometime ago I had a dream
It was happy, it was lasting, it was free
And now in life, oh, can't you see
How we can make that dream into reality?
[Verse 1]
And all the music, it was playing
And all the firelight, it was dancing
And all the children, they were singing
And all the people, they were loving
[Chorus]
Sometime ago I had a dream
It was happy, it was lasting, it was free
And now in life, oh, can't you see
How we can make that dream into reality?
[Verse 2]
Oh, the morning sun, it was soft and cool
Oh, the evening breeze, it was warm and gold
All together life had started to unfold
Sometime ago
[Instrumental]
