Who Made Who Lyrics
“Who Made Who” was the only song to be released as a single off of Who Made Who. The song was newly written for the  Maximum Overdrive soundtrack, along with “D.T.” and “Chase the Ace.”
[Verse 1]
The video game say "Play me"
Face it on a level, but it take you every time on a one-on-one
Feelin' runnin' down your spine
Nothin' gonna save your one last dime, 'cause it own you
Through and through
The databank know my number
Says I got to pay 'cause I made the grade last year
Feel it when I turn the screw
Kick you 'round the world, there ain't a thing that it can't do
Do to you, yeah
[Chorus]
(
Who made who?
) Who made you?
(
Who made who?
) Ain't nobody told you?
(
Who made who?
) Who made you?
If you made them and they made you
Who picked up the bill and who made who?
Yeah
Who made who?
Who turned the screw?
[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah, ooh, yeah
