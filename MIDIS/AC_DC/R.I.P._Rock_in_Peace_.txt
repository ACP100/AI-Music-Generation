R.I.P. (Rock in Peace) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Ah-ow, leave me alone
Like a dog with a bone
Like a stone that's been thrown
Let me be on my own
[Chorus]
Let me rock
Let me rock
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace
[Verse 2]
Out of my way
Got a boogie to play
Every dog has his day
Rock and roll's here to stay
[Chorus]
Let me rock
Let me roll
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace
[Refrain]
Woo
Ooh, feels good
Mama, mama
Just like I knew it would
