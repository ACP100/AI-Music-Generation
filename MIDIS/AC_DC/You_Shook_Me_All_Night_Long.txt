She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, tellin' me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Takin' more than her share, had me fightin' for air

Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shakin', the Earth was quakin'
My mind was achin', and we were makin' it
