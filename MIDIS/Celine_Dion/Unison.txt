Unison Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Somewhere tonight
We come alive
Two hearts ignite
We're one of a kind
Here we are undivided by anything
Just you and I
We've come so far, no one else could ever
Steal away what we confide
Who wants to know?
[Chorus]
We stick together we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one we do it in unison
[Verse 2]
Gleam of an eye, flash of a smile
Never too shy
Playin' ever so wild
Here we are I’m relying on no one else
But you and I
We’ve come so far
No one else could ever steal away what we
Confide who wants to know?
