Falling Into You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
And in your eyes, I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, "What's his is hers"
[Chorus]
I'm falling into you (Falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (Falling into you)
Falling into you
[Verse 2]
I was afraid (I was afraid) to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
The walls begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground
[Chorus]
I'm falling into you (Falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (Falling into you)
Falling into you
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are
