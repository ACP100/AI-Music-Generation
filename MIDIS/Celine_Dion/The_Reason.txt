The Reason Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I figured it out
I was high and low and everything in between
I was wicked and wild, baby, you know what I mean
Till there was you, yeah, you
Something went wrong
I made a deal with the devil for an empty 
I.O.U
Been to hell and back, but an angel was looking through
It was you, yeah, you
It's all because of you
[Chorus]
You are the reason
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
You are the reason, the reason
[Verse 2]
In the middle of the night (In the middle of the night)
I'm going down 'cause I adore you
I want to floor you
I'm giving it up
No more running around spinning my wheel
You came out of my dream and you made it real
I know what I feel
It's you
It's all because of you
