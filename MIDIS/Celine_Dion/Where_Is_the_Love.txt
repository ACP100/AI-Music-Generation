Where Is the Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If ever a boy stood on the moon
All the heavens would call them angels 'round
Stop the tears from troubled skies
From falling
If ever the river could whisper your name
Would the choices you made still be the same?
Like a flower that dies from angry rain
Why do we hurt ourselves?
[Chorus]
Where is the love that lets the sunlight in to start again?
A love that sees no color lines
Life begins with love
So spread your wings and fly
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered
A thousand dreams that we can still believe
[Verse 2]
If ever a boy stood on the moon
Carrying all of his treasures from the stars
To a rainbow which leads to where we are
Together we'd chase the sun
[Chorus]
Where is the love that lifts my brother's voice to the skies?
A love that answers a mother's cry
Life begins with love
So spread your wings and fly
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered
A thousand dreams that we can still believe
