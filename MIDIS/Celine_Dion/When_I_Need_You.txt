When I Need You Lyrics
[Chorus 1]
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
It's only a heart beat away
[Chorus 2]
When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
[Verse 1]
Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
Oh, but you know I won't be traveling for ever
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do
[Chorus 2]
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you baby
It's only a heart beat away
[Verse 3]
It's not easy when the road is your driver
Honey, that's a heavy load that we bear
But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime
It's cold out but hold out and do like I do
