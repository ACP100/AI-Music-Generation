I Donâ€™t Know Lyrics
[Verse 1]
A mountain of stone, a door of steel
Can't stand in my way, I'd go on
Brutal machines, unbending laws
Can't slow me down, I'd go on
I've learned how to deal and when to fight
I know what's real, I know what's right
I'm not afraid, a wounded dove
I can be tender in a world so tough
[Chorus]
I'm sure I could face the bitter cold
But life without you, I don't know
[Verse 2]
The winds of the heart can blow me down (Blow me down)
But I get right up
And I stand my ground
I've tasted fear, my share of pain
The wasted tears of love in vain
I've held you tight, pushed you away
Now with all my might I beg you to stay
[Chorus]
I'm sure I could face the bitter cold
But life without you, I don't know
