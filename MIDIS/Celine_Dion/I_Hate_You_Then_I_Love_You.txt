I Hate You Then I Love You Lyrics
[Verse 1: Céline Dion]
I'd like to run away from you
But if I were to leave you I would die
I'd like to break the chains you put around me
And yet I'll never try
[Verse 2: Luciano Pavarotti]
No matter what you do you drive me crazy
I'd rather be alone
But then I know my life would be so empty
As soon as you were gone
[Pre-Chorus: Luciano Pavarotti, 
Céline Dion
, 
Both
]
Impossible to live with you
But I could never live without you
For whatever you do
(For whatever you do)
I never, never, never
Want to be in love with anyone but you
[Chorus: Céline Dion, 
Luciano Pavarotti
, 
Both
]
You make me sad
You make me strong
You make me mad
You make me long for you
(You make me long for you)
You make me live
You make me die
You make me laugh
You make me cry for you
(You make me cry for you)
I hate you, then I love you
Then I love you, then I hate you
Then I love you, I love you more 
for whatever you do
I never, never, never
Want to be in love with anyone but you
