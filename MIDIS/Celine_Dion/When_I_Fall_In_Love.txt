When I Fall In Love Lyrics
[Chorus 1: Clive Griffin]
When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
[Verse 1: Clive Griffin]
In a restless world
Like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many
Moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
[Chorus 2: Céline Dion]
When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
[Verse 2: Céline Dion, 
Clive Griffin
, 
both
]
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
(I feel that way too)
Is when I fall in love 
(I fall in love)
With you
[Chorus 1: Clive Griffin & 
both
]
When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
(Ooh I'll never never fall in love)
