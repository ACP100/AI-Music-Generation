Immortality Lyrics
[Verse 1]
So this is who I am
And this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow
And I will stand for my dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
But you are my only
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead
And I won't let my heart control my head
But you are my only
[Chorus]
We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be
Immortality
I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me inside
[Verse 2]
Fulfill your destiny
Is there within' the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
The king of hearts
The joker's wild
