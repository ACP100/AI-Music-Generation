Where Does My Heart Beat Now Lyrics
[Verse 1]
So much to believe in, we were lost in time
Everything I needed I fell into your eyes
Always thought of keeping your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?
[Chorus]
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?
[Verse 2]
Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder, come and rescue me
Driven by the hunger of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go?
[Chorus]
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?
Where do all the lonely hearts go?
