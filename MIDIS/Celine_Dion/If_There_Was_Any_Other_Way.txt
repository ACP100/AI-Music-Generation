(If There Was) Any Other Way Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Sorry, I know I'm late
Guess I lost all track of time
Started walking and couldn't stop
Turning it over in my mind
Trying to make some sense of it
Trying to make the pieces fit
I thought I covered my tracks so well
But now he says he knew about it from the start
Yeah, he knew about us all along
[Chorus]
If there was any other way, love
Don't you think I've tried to find it?
Don't you think I want to stay?
If there was any other way, love
There's no way out of this
There just ain't any other way
[Verse 2]
Maybe I'd better be leaving now
But there's something I want you to understand before I go
Sometimes we don't have a choice when we play and break the rules
I just had to see you darlin', one more time
If only just to say good-bye
'Cause he knew about us all the time
