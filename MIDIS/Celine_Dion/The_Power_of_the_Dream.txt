The Power of the Dream Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Deep within each heart
There lies a magic spark
That lights the fire of our imagination
And since the dawn of man
The strength of just I can
Has brought together people of all nations
There's nothing ordinary in the living of each day
There's a special part every one of us will play
[Chorus]
Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
To bring us closer to the power of the dream
[Bridge]
As the world gives us its best
To stand apart from all the rest
It is the power of the dream that brings us here
[Verse 2]
Your mind will take you far
The rest is just your heart
You'll find your fate is all your own creation
And every boy and girl as they come into this world
Bring the gift of hope and inspiration
