Iâ€™m Loving Every Moment With You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Do you realize how long it's been?
Where does all my time with you go?
And all the memories
We shared as friends
Reflected in my heart
Is where they show
[Chorus]
I'm loving every moment with you
I'm living in a dream that's comin' true
I'm lost in everything you do
I love you
I'm saving every moment for you
You're hidden in a place that's safe and true
Lovin' everything we do
[Verse 2]
With every second
You hold me near
I'm closer to a place I want to be
To hear you whisper
But no one else can hear
I want your love
To stay forever, inside of me
