The Long Race Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's a hazy winter's day
And I'm staring out on the southland
In the twilight distance on the bay
My mind sees you running through the marshland
[Pre-Chorus]
All of these years I've been waiting for you
Through high tides and the low tides too
But if I stop now how could I ever be with you? (Woah)
[Chorus]
It's a long, long race
If I try I will surely finish
It's a long, long race (yeah)
If I try I will surely win it
One day, one night with you
[Verse 2]
There's a village on the lower eastern shore
Where the watermen's boats are anchored
And they work so hard all day long
Showing me what you want to go after
[Pre-Chorus]
All of these years I've been pushing so hard
Through high tides and the low tides too
But if I stop now how could I know what I could do? (Woah)
