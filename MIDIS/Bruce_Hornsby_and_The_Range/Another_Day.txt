Another Day Lyrics
Woke up this morning looking at the screen
There's a couple of men talking
I'm not so sure what they mean
There's a conversation, many men running wild
We learn about the world while they're fighting in the aisles
Here we go
What do you say, what do you know
You've got your life and you watch it away
It's just another day in this old town
So get down
Home Shopping Channel's got us by the eyes
Scrambling to the phones ordering porcelain flies
Talk to the women talk to the wives
Everybody's buying important things for their lives
Here we go
What do you say, what do you know
You've got your life and you watch it away
It's just another day in this old town
So get down
He's a high performance engine with Jesus as the fuel
Old father's handing out forty acres and a mule
Preaching the word of prosperity
Make a little more money they might just put you on TV
