The Musicâ€™s No Good Without You Lyrics
[Intro]
Without you
[Chorus]
The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me (Come back to me)
The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me (Come back to me)
[Verse 1]
Everyone was watching
You were the freakiest thing on show
Dazzle in the crystal ball
They all loved to watch it glow
You were the center of attention
The eye of the storm
A whirlwind from outer space
Like a twister on the scene
[Chorus]
The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me (Come back to me)
The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me (Come back to me)
