[Spoken]
Dove sei adesso? Dove sei, amore mio?
[Verse 1]
Dov'è l'amore? Dov'è l'amore?
I cannot tell you of my love, here is my story
I'll sing a love song, sing it for you alone
Though you're a thousand miles away, the feeling so strong
[Chorus]
Come to me, baby, don't keep me waiting
Another night without you here and I'll go crazy
There is no other, there is no other
No other love can take your place or match the beauty of your face
I'll keep on singing 'til the day
I carry you away with my love song, with my love song
[Verse 2]
Dov'è l'amore? Dov'è l'amore?
Where are you now, my love? I need you here to hold me
Whispered so sweetly, feel my heart beating
I need to hold you in my arms, I want you near me
[Chorus]
Come to me, baby, don't keep me waiting
Another night without you here and I'll go crazy
There is no other, there is no other
No other love can take your place or match the beauty of your face
I'll keep on singing 'til the day
I carry you away with my love song, oh, with my love song
