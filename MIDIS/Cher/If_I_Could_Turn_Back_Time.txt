[Intro]
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay
[Verse 1]
I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes
[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby
[Chorus]
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you, you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time
[Verse 2]
My world was shattered, I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
When you walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything, darlin', then and there
