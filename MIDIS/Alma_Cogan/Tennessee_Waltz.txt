Tennessee Waltz Lyrics
I was dancin' with my darlin'
To the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my darlin'
And while they were dancin'
My friend stole my lover from me
Oh, I remember the night
And the Tennessee Waltz
'now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin'
The night they were playing
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
I remember the night ...
She goes dancin' with the darkness
To the Tennessee Waltz
And I feel like I'm falling apart
And it's stronger than drink
And it's deeper than sorrow
This darkness she left in my heart
I remember the night ...
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
