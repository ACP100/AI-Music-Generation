Everybody Lyrics
[Intro: DJ BoBo]
Music is what I'm living for
[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Rüsch]
Everybody loves to dance
With another summer romance, ooh baby
Everybody likes to move
All the fellas havin' the groove, ooh baby
[Chorus: Jennifer Rüsch]
Everybody move your feet
To the rhythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
All the people having fun
Everybody move your feet
To the rhythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
All the people having fun
[Verse 1: DJ BoBo]
Music is what I'm living for
Hit the dance floor like there ain't no more
Ain't no more time for taking your chance
Jam-diggity-jam to the summer romance
Wave your hands in the air, everyone and everywhere
Move your body, jump around, check it out with the sound
Everybody, everybody, get up and sing it loud
This is the sound that makes you feel proud
