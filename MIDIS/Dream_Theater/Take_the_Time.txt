Take the Time Lyrics
[Intro]
Just let me catch my breath...
I've heard the promises
I've seen the mistakes
I've had my fair share of tough breaks
I need a new voice
, a new law
A new way
Take the time, re-evaluate
It's time to pick up the pieces
Go back to square one
I think it's time for a change!
[Verse 1]
There is something that I feel
To be something that is real
I feel the heat within my mind
And craft new changes with my eyes
Giving freely wandering promises
A place with decisions I'll fashion
I won't waste another breath
[Chorus 1]
You can feel the waves coming on
(It's time to take the time!)
Let them destroy you or carry you on
(It's time to take the time!)
You're fighting the weight of the world
But no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind
