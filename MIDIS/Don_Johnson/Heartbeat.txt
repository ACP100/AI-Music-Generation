Heartbeat Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I don't care what you say
You can give it away
Your money don't mean much to me
I've been out on my own
Going to go it alone now
Cause that's the way it's got to be
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody tells me how
I can beat the odds for now
I've been standing by the fire
I just can't feel the heat
Can't feel the heat
[Chorus]
Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Beating like mine
[Verse 2]
Looking at me, it's easy to see
You think you know just how I feel
Well you do me wrong
And it won't take me long
Before my restless heart will heal
