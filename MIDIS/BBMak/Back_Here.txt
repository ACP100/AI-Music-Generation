Back Here Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Baby, set me free
From this misery
I can't take it no more
Since you ran away
Nothing's been the same
Don't know what I'm livin' for
[Pre-Chorus]
Here I am, so alone
And there's nothin' in this world I can do
[Chorus]
Until you're back here, baby
Miss you, want you, need you so
Until you're back here baby, yeah
There's a feelin' inside
I want you to know
You are the one, and I can't let you go
[Verse 2]
So I told you lies
Even made you cry
Baby, I was so wrong
Girl, I promise you
Now my love is true
This is where my heart belongs
