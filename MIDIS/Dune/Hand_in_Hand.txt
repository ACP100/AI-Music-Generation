Hand in Hand Lyrics
Let's go hand in hand
Into lovely land
Side by side
To a world that shines so bright
Let's go hand in hand
Into lovely land
Side by side
Follow me into the light
Into lovely land
Side by side
To a world that shines so bright
Let's go hand in hand
Into lovely land
Side by side
Follow me into the light
Into lovely land
Side by side
To a world that shines so bright
Let's go hand in hand
Into lovely land
Side by side
Follow me into the light
