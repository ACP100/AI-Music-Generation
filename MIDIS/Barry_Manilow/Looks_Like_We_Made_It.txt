Looks Like We Made It Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There you are
Looking just the same as you did last time I touched you
And here I am
Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you love him
As much as I love her?
And will that love be strong
When old feelings start to stir?
[Chorus]
Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so 'til today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it
[Verse 2]
Love's so strange
Playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting
And we're the fools
Standing close enough to touch those burning memories
