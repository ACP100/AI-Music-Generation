Bandstand Boogie Lyrics
We're goin' hoppin' (Hop)
We're goin' hoppin' today
Where things are poppin' (Pop)
The Philadelphia way
We're gonna drop in (Drop)
On all the music they play
On the Bandstand (Bandstand)
We're goin' swingin' (Swing)
We're gonna swingin' the crowd
And we'll be clingin' (Cling)
And floatin' high as a cloud
The phones are ringin' (Ring)
My mom and dad are so proud
I'm on Bandstand (Bandstand)
And I'll jump, and hey, I may even show 'em my handstand
Because I'm on, because I'm on the American Bandstand
When we dance real slow I'll show all the guys in the grandstand
What a swinger I am, I am on American Bandstand
We're goin' hoppin'
We're goin' hoppin' today
Where things are poppin'
The Philadelphia way
We're gonna drop in
On all the music they play
On the Bandstand (Bandstand)
