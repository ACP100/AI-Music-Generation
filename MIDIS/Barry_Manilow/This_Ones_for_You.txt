This Oneâ€™s for You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
This one will never sell
They'll never understand
I don't even sing it well
I try, but I just can't
But I sing it every night
And I fight to keep it in
'Cause this one's for you
This one's for you
[Verse 2]
I've done a hundred songs
From fantasies to lies
But this one's so real for me that I'm the one who cries
And I sing it every night
And I fight to hide the tears
'Cause this one's for you
This one's for you
[Chorus]
This one's for you wherever you are
To say that nothing's been the same
Since we've been apart
This one's for all the love we once knew
Like everything else I have
This one's for you, ohh
