Itâ€™s a Miracle Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You wouldn't believe where I've been
The cities and towns I've been in
From Boston to Denver
And every town in between
[Verse 2]
(Everyone looks the same)
The people, they all look the same
(Yes, the same)
Oh, only the names have been changed
(Just the names)
But now that I'm home again
I'll tell you what I believe
[Chorus]
It's a miracle (Miracle)
A true blue spectacle
A miracle come true
(Whoa, ohh, ohh, ohh)
We're together, baby
I was going crazy
'Til the miracle came through
(Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh)
Now you're here and my arms are around you
And, baby, there'll be dancing in the street
For the miracle (Miracle)
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you
(Woo! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
(Hoo!)
