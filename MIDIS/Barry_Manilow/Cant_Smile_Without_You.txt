Canâ€™t Smile Without You Lyrics
[Chorus]
You know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see, I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
[Verse]
You came along just like a song
And brightened my day
Who'd have believed that you were part of a dream?
Now it all seems light-years away
[Chorus]
And now you know I can't smile without you (No I can't smile without you)
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see, I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile
