The Promised Land Lyrics
Let me take you to the promised land
You and I, together we stand
Let me guide you to tomorrow
Let me free you from the sorrow
Let me take you to a place I know
Soul to soul, baby it shows
Let me free you from the sorrow
Let me guide you to tomorrow
The sky is filled with lovely colours
Surrender your love, this night is ours
It feels like heaven when you're by my side
Your tender touch makes me feel alright
Cause you and I belong together
Being with you is all that matters
Journey of love, hand in hand
A dream comes true in the promised land
Don't stop, kick the hardcore party people
Do you want:
Don't stop: DJ Paul DJ Paul
Don't stop, move your body
DJ Paul is on this party
Take me to the promised land, promised land
