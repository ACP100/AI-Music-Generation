Rainbow in the Sky Lyrics
[Intro]
Das dj Paul Elstak, jonguh!
Ey, wa hoor ik daar nou, jonguh
I wanna see a rainbow high in the sky
I wanna see you and me
Hey, das een ander nummer
[Chorus]
I wanna see the rainbow high in the sky
I wanna see you and me on a bird flying away
Then I hope to see your smile every night and day
I wanna see the rainbow high in the sky
I wanna see you and me on a bird flying away
Then I hope to see your smile every night and day
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
I wanna see the rainbow high in the sky
I wanna see you and me on a bird flying away
Then I hope to see your smile every night and day
I wanna see the rainbow high in the sky
I wanna see you and me on a bird flying away
Then I hope to see your smile every night and day
Rainbow high in the sky
You and me on a bird flying away
I hope to see your smile every night and day
