Rave on Lyrics
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
Everybody leave your worries behind
You gotta open your mind and just rave on, rave on
Future is ours because we are the young
Together we're strong and just rave on, rave on
Everybody leave your worries behind
You gotta open your mind and just rave on, rave on
Future is ours because we are the young
Together we're strong and just rave on, rave on
Party people, just rave on
One for the home and two for the show
Check it out and let it go
You gotta keep on raving
You gotta keep on raving
You gotta keep on raving
You gotta keep on raving
You gotta keep on raving
You gotta keep on raving
Everybody leave your worries behind
You gotta open your mind and just rave on, rave on
Future is ours because we are the young
Together we're strong and just rave on, rave on
