September in the Rain Lyrics
“September in the Rain,” written in 1937, was originally introduced by James Melton in the film Melody for Two. The song became a standard being recorded by many artists such as The Beatles and Frank Sinatra.
The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying amber
That September in the rain
To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain
Though spring is here, to me it's still September
That September in the rain
To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain
Though spring is here, to me it's still September
That September in the rain
