Everything I Own Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm
Kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free
You set me free
[Pre-Chorus]
Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you
[Chorus]
And I would give everything I own!
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again!
[Verse 2]
You taught me how to cry
I don't know, why?
Just don't know, why?
You gave my life to me
You set me free
You set me free
