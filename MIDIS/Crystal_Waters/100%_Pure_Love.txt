[Intro]
Pure love
[Verse 1]
It's twelve past midnight
Don't close your eyes
Your soul's half alive
And I'll be by your side
I've come to take you there
Show you how to care
Just be aware
That you'll have to share
[Refrain]
I want your love
I want it tonight
I'm taking your heart
So don't you fight
I'll be your answer
I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
Your favorite dish
[Chorus]
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
