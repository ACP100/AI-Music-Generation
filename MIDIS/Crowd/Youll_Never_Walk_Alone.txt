Youâ€™ll Never Walk Alone Lyrics
[Verse]
When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
There's a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of the lark
[Chorus]
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone!
You'll never walk alone
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone!
You'll never walk alone!
