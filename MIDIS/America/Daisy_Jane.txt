Daisy Jane Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Flyin' me back to Memphis
Gotta find my Daisy Jane
Well, the summer's gone and I hope she's feelin' the same
Well, I left her just to roam the city
Thinkin' it would ease the pain
I'm a crazy man and I'm playing my crazy game, game
[Chorus]
Does she really love me? I think she does
Like the stars above me, I know because
When the sky is bright, everything's all right
[Verse 2]
Flyin' me back to Memphis
Honey, keep the oven warm
All the clouds are clearin' and I think we're over the storm
Well, I've been picking it up around me
Daisy, I think I'm sane (Daisy, I think I'm sane)
Well, I'm awful glad and I guess you're really to blame, blame
[Chorus]
Do you really love me? I hope you do
Like the stars above me, how I love you
When it's cold at night, everything's all right
