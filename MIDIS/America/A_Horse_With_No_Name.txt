A Horse With No Name Lyrics
Written by Dewey Bunnell, this song was the band America’s first and most successful single, released in 1972. Originally titled “Desert Song,” then changed to the catchier current name.
[Verse 1]
On the first part of the journey
I was lookin' at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot
 and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound
[Chorus]
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
[Verse 2]
After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was lookin' at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead
