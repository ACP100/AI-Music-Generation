Muskrat Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Muskrat, muskrat candlelight
Doing the town and doing it right
In the evening, it's pretty pleasing
Muskrat Susie, Muskrat Sam
Do the jitterbug out in muskrat land
And they shimmy, Sammy's so skinny
[Chorus]
And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singing and jinging the jango
Floating like the heavens above
Looks like muskrat love
[Verse 2]
Nibbling on bacon, chewing on cheese
Sammy says to Susie, "Honey, would you please
Be my missus?" and she says yes with her kisses
And now he's tickling her fancy, rubbing her toes (Rubbing her toes)
Muzzle to muzzle, now anything goes
As they wriggle and Sue starts to giggle
[Chorus]
And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singing and jinging the jango
Floating like the heavens above
Looks like muskrat love
