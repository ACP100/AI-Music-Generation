Lonely People Lyrics
[Verse 1]
This is for all the lonely people
Thinkin' that life has passed them by
[Refrain 1]
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
And ride that highway in the sky
[Verse 2]
This is for all the single people
Thinkin' that love has left them dry
[Refrain 2]
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
You never know until you try
[Bridge]
Well, I'm on my way
Yes, I'm back to stay
Well, I'm on my way back home (Hit it)
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
This is for all the lonely people
Thinkin' that life has passed them by
