Story of a Lonely Guy Lyrics
The fifth track from Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, “Story of a Lonely Guy” is about a lonely guy who likes a girl but is too embarrassed and shy to do anything and so he stays alone and sad.
[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Push it out, fake a smile
Avert disaster just in time
I need a drink, 'cause in a while
Worthless answers from friends of mine
It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore
Girls possess me but they're never mine
I made my entrance, avoided hazards
Checked my engine, I fell behind
[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Duh da, duh da, duh da, duh da duh, I fell behind
Duh da, duh da, duh da, duh da duh
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone, I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this, like the prom
I get too scared to move, 'cause I'm a fuckin' boy
[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Remember when I was in
The grocery store, now's my time
Lost the words, lost the nerve
Lost the girl, left the line
I would wish upon a star
But that star, it doesn't shine
So read my book with a boring ending
A short story of a lonely guy
