Please Take Me Home Lyrics
[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Oh no, it happened again
She's cool, she's hot, she's my friend
I'd drive for hours, it's so
You leave me nowhere to go
[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated wrong
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had
[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
I hope, hope that it lasts
Give in, forget the past
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest, this breaks my heart
[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated wrong
