A classic song about jealousy and wishing you could have another chance.
[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
Josie, you're my
Source of most frustration
Forget when I
Don't meet expectations
Everything you wished came true
In the end, we all blamed you
Even though, as they all know
You weren't the only one, two
Three, four...
[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down? I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I got to wonder why you'd leave it out for me
 
(Shit!)
[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down? I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard, I'm hating everything
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright, it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night, I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend?
