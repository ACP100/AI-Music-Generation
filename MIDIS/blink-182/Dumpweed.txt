[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, I could never leave her
If I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this, I ask, it's what I want to know

Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me?
Another guy, you think he'd wanna fight me?
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]

She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
