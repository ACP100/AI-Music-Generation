Shut Up Lyrics
“Shut Up” is a vulgar track where Mark Hoppus writes about the fallout of a toxic relationship involving him and his ex-lover. Nothing screams “break-up song” like lots of swearing!
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
"Shut the fuck up", she said, "I'm going fucking deaf
You're always too loud, everything's too loud
Now that all my friends left, this place is fucking dead
I wanna move out, when can we move out?"
[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
This shit has gotta stop
I'll run away...
[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
"Get the fuck up", she said, "your life is meaningless
It's going nowhere, you're going nowhere
You're just a fuck up", she said, 
"I'll live alone instead"
She said, "you don't care", I know, I don't care
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I'll never ask permission from you
Fuck off, I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home
I'm never going to come back home
[Verse 3: Mark Hoppus]
I got too fucked up again and passed out on the plane
Tried to forget you, I can't forget you
Now sleep on this flight, I'll think about the nights
We had to get through, I didn't get you
