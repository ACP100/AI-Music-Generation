Aaah
[Verse 1:]
You set my lips on fire
You won the key to my heart
You've got a special way to move me
Can't stop now
Let's do it again
You keep me dancing through the moonlight
I feel the pleasure in your touch
And everything you are is heaven
Oh I can't get enough
No, I can't get enough
[Chorus:]
Instant replay
Got to have it
Instant replay
Ooh, whoa, ooh-ooh
Instant replay
Got to have your love again
