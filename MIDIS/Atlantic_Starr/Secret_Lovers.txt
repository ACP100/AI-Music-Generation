[Verse 1: Barbara Weathers]
Here we are
The two of us together
Taking this crazy chance
To be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if we're found out
It could mess up both our happy homes
[Verse 2: David Lewis]
I hate to think about us
All meeting up together
'Cause soon as I looked at you
It would show on my face
Then they'll know that
We've been loving each other
They can never know
No, no, no
We can't leave a trace
[Chorus]
Secret lovers, yeah
That's what we are
We shouldn't be together
But we can't let it go, no no
'Cause we love each other so
