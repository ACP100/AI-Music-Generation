Sweets For My Sweet Lyrics
Now sweetness
A whe the gall them love the best
And you know sch we no careless
You understan'
Satisfaction guaranteed
I got all the gal dem need
Unu ready
Have mercy
Sweets for my sweet
Sugar for my honey
Your first sweet kiss thrilled me so
Sweets for my sweet

I'll never ever let you go
Sweetness look how the gall them a dress
All the man them a seh them impress
Niceness a whe the gall them a wear
All the man them a seh you gone clear
Sweetness look how the gall them a dress
All the man them a seh them impress
Niceness a whe the gall them a wear
All the man them a seh you gone clear
Beca me love how the gall them
Love how the gall them
