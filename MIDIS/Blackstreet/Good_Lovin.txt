Good Lovin’ Lyrics
[Intro: Chauncey "Black" Hannibal & 
James Brown
]
Good lovin' (
Bad self
)
Uh, yeah (
Bad— Bad self
)
Blackstreet coming back at ya (
Bad— Bad— Bad self
)
For your nine-six (
Bad— Bad self
)
Kicking it live (
Bad— Bad— Bad self
)
I'ma do this with a little Chauncey Black style (
Bad— Bad self
)
Mm (
Bad— Bad— Bad self
)
Listen (
Bad— Bad self, bad— bad—
)
[Verse 1: Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
My mama told me
That there would be a day like this
I would run into someone
Who would just knock me off my feet
That kind of woman
Who would be right there for me
Never thought that it could be
But now it's happening to me
[Pre-Chorus: Chauncey & Blackstreet]
I finally found someone
To give me all her affection
And I wanna keep her right here next to me
Thinking about me and my lady
Giving her love all night and through the day (Getting that feelin')
All I want is good lovin' (Oh, oh, oh)
