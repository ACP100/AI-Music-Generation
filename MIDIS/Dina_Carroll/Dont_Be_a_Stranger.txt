Donâ€™t Be A Stranger Lyrics
I shouldn't be alone with you tonight
Desire was too strong to put up a fight
I don't understand the way I feel
Although it feels so right
I really shouldn't be...
Here tonight
In your eyes there's a sign of intensity
I sense an atmosphere
No need to hide from the way that you feel inside
There's nothing left to fear
(chorus)
If only for tonight
(don't be a stranger)
I wanna take this chance
Risk it all for you
Knowing what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight
(don't be a stranger)
I want it all from you
Tonight
You're on my mind all of the time
I really shouldn't stay with you tonight
But the more and more I think of it
The more it just seems right
That's why I shouldn't be...
Here tonight
