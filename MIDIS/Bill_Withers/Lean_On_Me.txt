Lean on Me Lyrics
It’s not often that a song works equally well as a Black Nationalism anthem and as an educational song for little children.  “Lean on Me” fits the bill.
[Intro]
Hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
[Verse 1]
Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow
[Chorus]
Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
[Verse 2]
Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill
Those of your needs
That you won't let show
