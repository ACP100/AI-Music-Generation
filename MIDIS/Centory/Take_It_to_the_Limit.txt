Take It To The Limit Lyrics
I looked up in the sky and I see
The stars are shining all so brightly
And I can't get you off of my mind
A beam of light will shine upon you
And show you now that I can be true
And I can't get you off of my mind
We gotta take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the top
If you understand it's never gonna stop
Take it to the limit
Take it to the top
And if you're gonna get there
We gotta take it to the limit
Take it to the limit, baby
Just like a doughnut
Glaze me
You drive me crazy
The way you make me feel
Real deal
Holyfield
Like a magnet to steel
