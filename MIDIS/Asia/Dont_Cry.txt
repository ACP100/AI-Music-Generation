[Verse 1]
Hard times you had before you
I knew when I first saw you
You girl you've always been mistreated, cheated
So leave it all behind you
It took so long to find you
I know that we can last forever, ever and more, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Don't cry now that I've found you
Don't cry take a look around you
Don't cry it took so long to find you
Do what you want, but little darling please, don't cry
[Verse 2]
I knew I'd never doubt it
I was so sure about it
Don't think of all that's been before
I'll hear you when you're calling
I'll catch you when you're falling
Don't worry I will always be there
Like never before, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Don't cry now that I've found you
Don't cry take a look around you
Don't cry it took so long to find you
Do what you want, but little darling please, don't cry
Don't cry now that I've found you
Don't cry take a look around you
Don't cry it took so long to find you
Do what you want, but little darling please, don't cry
