The Smile Has Left Your Eyes Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I saw you standing hand in hand
But now you come to me the solitary man
And I know what it is that made us live such ordinary lives
The where to go, the who to see
No one could sympathize
[Chorus 1]
The smile has left your eyes
The smile has left your eyes
[Verse 2]
And I've become a rolling stone
I don't know where to go, or what to call my own
But I can see that black horizon
Looming ever close to view
It's over now, it's not my fault
See how this feels for you
[Chorus 1]
The smile has left your eyes
The smile has left your eyes
[Bridge]
I never thought I'd see you
Standing there with him
So don't come crawling back to me
