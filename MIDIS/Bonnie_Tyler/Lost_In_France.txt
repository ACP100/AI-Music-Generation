Lost in France Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was lost in France
In the fields, the birds were singing
I was lost in France
And the day was just beginning
[Chorus]
As I stood there in the morning rain
I had a feeling I can't explain
I was lost in France in love
[Verse 2]
I was lost in France
In the street, a band was playing
And the crowd all danced
Didn't catch what they were saying
[Chorus]
When I looked up, he was standing there
And I knew I shouldn't, but I didn't care
I was lost in France in love
[Refrain]
Ooh, la-la-la, ooh, la-la-la, dance
Ooh, la-la-la, I'm dancing
Ooh, la-la-la, ooh, la-la-la, dance
Ooh, la-la-la, I'm dancing
Ooh, la-la-la, ooh, la-la-la, dance
Ooh, la-la-la, I'm dancing
