[Intro]
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Ah, ah
[Verse 1]
Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the risin' odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need
[Chorus]
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero (

I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light (
Hero till the morning light
)
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life, larger than life
[Post-Chorus]
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Ah, ah
