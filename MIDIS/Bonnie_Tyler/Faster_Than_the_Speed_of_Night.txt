Faster Than the Speed of Night Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I don't want to let another minute get by
They're slipping through our fingers, but we're ready to fly
The night'll be our cover and we'll huddle below
We've got the music in our bodies and the radio
[Verse 2]
And when the morning arrives, it'll all be gone
Disappearing into the crack of dawn
We better make our move now (Now)
Before the sun is awake (Before the sun is awake)
It's time to put up or shut up and to pick up the pace
(It's time to put up or shut up and to pick up the pace)
(Baby, baby, baby)
[Verse 3]
We never want to let another minute get by
Love is going to get us while the moon is in the sky
We're running out of night, but never running out of steam
We're acting on a hunch, but we'll be acting out a dream
[Pre-Chorus]
There really isn't any time to lose
They're going to catch us if we wait until it gets too light
You're such a pretty boy
Let me show you what to do and you'll do it (What to do and you'll do it)
But you gotta move faster
Faster than the speed of night
