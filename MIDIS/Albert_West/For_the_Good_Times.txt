For the Good Times Lyrics
Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we have some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
In a whisper of the raindrops flowing soft across the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
In a whisper of the raindrops flowing soft across the window
And make believe you love me one more time
