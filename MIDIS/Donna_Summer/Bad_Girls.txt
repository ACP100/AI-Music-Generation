Bad Girls Lyrics
[Intro]
Toot toot, hey, beep beep
Toot toot, hey, beep beep
Toot toot, hey, beep beep
Toot toot, hey, beep beep
[Chorus 1]
Bad girls, talking 'bout the sad girls
Sad girls, talking 'bout bad, bad girls, yeah
[Verse 1]
See them out on the street at night (Walkin')
Picking up all kinds of strangers,
 
if the price is right
You can score if your pocket's tight
But you want a good time
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You ask yourself who they are
Like everybody else, they come from near and far
Woah, bad girls, yeah
[Chorus 1]
Bad girls (Bad girls), talking 'bout the sad girls, yeah (Sad girls)
The sad girls (Sad girls), talking 'bout bad, bad girls, yeah
[Verse 2]
Friday night and the strip is hot (Hot)
Sun's gone down and they're out to trot (Out trottin')
Spirit's high and legs look hot
Do you wanna get down?
