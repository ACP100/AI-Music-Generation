[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall
[Chorus]
Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff,
 gotta have some love tonight
(Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
I need hot stuff
[Verse 2]

Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm-blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home
[Chorus]
Gotta have some hot love, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin', gotta have love tonight (Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
Hot love, lookin' for hot love
