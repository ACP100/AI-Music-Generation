Max Donâ€™t Have Sex with Your Ex Lyrics
[Intro: Lyane Leigh]
Oh Max
Don't have sex
[Verse 1: David Brandes as "Max"]
Well I'm Max, I'm Max, baby, call me Max
I'm in love with you and also my ex
Well I'm Max, Max, call me Max
I'm takin' what I'm givin', and I'm givin' what it takes
Max, Max, Max
I'm in love with you, and I love my ex
I love you both, and to be true
I don't know what I'm gonna do!
[Chorus: Lyane Leigh]
I gotta warn you
Max, don't have sex with your ex
It will make your life complex
My Max, baby, take it easy!
Max, don't have sex with your ex
It will knock you off your legs
Oh Max, play it cool and just relax!
[Verse 2: Deon Blue as "Max"]
Well I'm Max, I'm Max, baby, call me Max
I'm in love with you, and I love my ex
Well I'm Max, Max, call me Max
'Cause you love havin' fun, love having sex
I'm Max, Max, Max
I'm in love with you, and I love my ex
I don't wanna make you feel so blue
I don't know what I'm gonna do!
