Fritz Love My Tits Lyrics
[Intro: Lyane Leigh]
Hey, hey, hey Fritz! Your key fits nicely
My body opens to your touch
So ring my bell and just entice me
I need your lovin' oh so much
'Cause he's wild, and baby, when he aims, he hits
Oh Fritz, I know you love my tits
[Verse 1: David Brandes as "Max"]
Fritz, Fritz, beat it, Fritz
And take your fingers off her tits
And if she says she loves you too
It's a lie, oh my, it just ain't true
Fritz, Fritz, listen, Fritz
Don't tell me it's your key that fits
You say she's yours, but I say well
I'm gonna get you down to hell!
[Chorus: Lyane Leigh]
Hey, hey, hey Fritz! Your key fits nicely
My body opens to your touch
So ring my bell and just entice me
I need your lovin' oh so much
Hey, hey, hey Fritz! I know I thrill you
But if you love me, please take care
'Cause if Max gets you, he will kill you
You better watch out for him, Fritz
