Sex on the Phone Lyrics
[Intro: Lyane Leigh]
Sex on the phone, I'm so alone
Some sex on the phone, I need it so
Okay, I'll do what you say, come on
Just make me fly
Just make me cry
Just make me cum
And get me high
[Verse 1: David Brandes as "Max"]
Baby, this is number one
And we'll have a lot of fun
Baby, this is number two
And I tell you what to do
Baby, this is number three
Feel my hand wrap on your knee
Baby, baby, just relax
Max will give you telephone sex
[Chorus: Lyane Leigh]
Sex on the phone, I'm so alone
Some sex on the phone, I need it so
Okay, I'll do what you say, come on
And give me sex on the phone so I can feel
Your sex on the phone is really real
Your touch, I want it so much
I want sex on the phone
