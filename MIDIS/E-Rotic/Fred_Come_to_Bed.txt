Fred Come to Bed Lyrics
[Chorus: Lyane Leigh]
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh, Fred, come to bed
'Cause my Max had sex with his sexy ex
Oh Fred, come to bed
Baby, I won't let your dreams get wet
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh
[Post-Chorus: Lyane Leigh]
Oh Fred
[Verse 1: David Brandes as "Max"]
Well I'm Max, I'm Max, baby, don't be blue
Don't you worry, don't be sorry, I'll come back to you
Just one more night with my poor old ex
She's only lonely, we don't have sex
I'm Max, Max, Max
Baby, please stay cool and just relax
I'll soon be back, but if you feel sad
Just go and talk to my friend Fred
[Chorus: Lyane Leigh]
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh, Fred, come to bed
'Cause my Max had sex with his sexy ex
Oh Fred, come to bed
Baby, I won't let your dreams get wet
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh, Fred, come to bed
Maybe you will get a love you never had
So Fred, come to bed
Or my fantasy will drive me mad
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh
