Good Morning Sunshine Lyrics
[Verse 1: Lene]
When the sun is up on a clear blue sky
You will act like a lover
When the sky is grey and the rain comes down
You will run for cover
[Pre-Chorus: Lene]
Feel the heat, come out of cold
And your arm is touchin' me
[Chorus: Lene]
Good mornin', sunshine
You're my only light
Lyin' with me by my side
You keep me warm all day
Just stay with me
Good mornin', sunshine
Be with me all day
Just don't let the rain pass you by
When it's cloudy or windy
And the snowflakes arrive
You somehow just make me
Make me feel I'm alive
[Verse 2: Lene]
When you leave my field, then you light the stars
Fadin' away in horizon
There's a million streets leadin' off the night
Waiting for sun to be risen
