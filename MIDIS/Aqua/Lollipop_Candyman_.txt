Lollipop (Candyman) Lyrics
[Intro: René, 
Lene
]
(
Oh
) I am the Candyman
(
Oh
) Comin' from Bountyland
(
Oh
) I am the Candyman
(
Oh
) Comin' from Bountyland
[Verse 1: Lene]
I wish that you were my lollipop
Sweet things, I will never get enough
If you show me to the sugar tree
Will you give me a soda pop for free?
[Pre-Chorus: René, 
Lene
]
Come with me, honey, I'm your sweet sugar Candyman (
Oh
)
Run like the wind, fly with me to Bountyland (
Oh
)
Bite me, I'm yours, if you're hungry, please understand
 (
Oh
)
This is the end of the sweet sugar Candyman
[Chorus: Lene]
Oh, my love, I know you are my Candyman
And oh, my love, your word is my command
Oh, my love, I know you are my Candyman
And oh, my love, let us fly to Bountyland
[Post-Chorus: Lene]
(Oh) You are my lollipop
(Oh) Sugar, sugar top
(Oh) You are my lollipop
(Oh) Sugar, sugar top
