Roses Are Red Lyrics
[Intro: Lene Nystrøm]
Roses are red and violets are blue
Honey is sweet but not as sweet as you
Roses are red and violets are blue
​
ad-id-ad-id-mud, ad-id-ad-id-muD
[Chorus: Lene Nystrøm, 
René Dif
]
Dum-di-da-di-da
Dum-di-da-di-da
Dum-di-da-di-da
Dum-di-da-di-da
Dum-di-da-di-da
Dum-di-da-di-da
Come pick my roses
[Verse 1: Lene Nystrøm]
Sweet from the flowers, honey from the bees
I got a feelin' I'm ready to release
Roses are red and violets are blue
Honey is sweet but not as sweet as you
[Pre-Chorus: René Dif]
It's invisible but so touchable
And I can feel it on my body, so emotional
I'm on a ride, on a ride, I'm a passenger
I'm a victim of a hot love messenger
