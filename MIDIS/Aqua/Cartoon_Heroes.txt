Cartoon Heroes Lyrics
[Verse 1: Lene Nystrøm & 
René Dif
]
We are what we're supposed to be
Illusions of your fantasy
All dots and lines that speak and say
What we do is what you wish to do
We are the color symphony
We do the things you wanna see
Frame by frame, to the extreme
[Verse 2: Lene Nystrøm]
Our friends are so unreasonable
They do the unpredictable
All dots and lines that speak and say
What we do is what you wish to do
[Pre-Chorus: René Dif]
It's all an orchestra of strings
Doin' unbelievable things
Frame by frame, to the extreme
One by one, we're makin' it fun
[Chorus: Lene Nystrøm & René Dif]
We are the Cartoon Heroes, oh-woah-oh
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
We came out of a crazy mind, oh-woah-oh
And we're all flatter than a piece of paper
