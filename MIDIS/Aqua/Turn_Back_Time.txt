Turn Back Time Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Give me time to reason
Give me time to think it through
Passing through the season
Where I cheated you
[Pre-Chorus]
I will always have a cross to wear
But the bolt reminds me I was there
So give me strength to face this test of mine
[Chorus]
If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time
I would stay for the night
For the night
[Verse 2]
Claim your right to science
Claim your right to see the truth
Though my pangs of conscience
Will drill a hole in you
[Pre-Chorus]
I seen it coming like a thief in the night
I seen it coming from the flash of your light
So give me strength to face this test of mine
