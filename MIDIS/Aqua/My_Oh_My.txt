My Oh My Lyrics
[Intro: Lene]
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To have the kingdom, baby, tell me why
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To rule the country, baby, you and I
If you were my king
[Chorus: Lene]
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To have the kingdom, baby, tell me why
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To rule the country, baby, you and I
[Verse 1: Lene]
Little princess in a terrible mess
A kingdom alone but no love to confess
Dreams of a prince on a tall white horse
Runs like a spirit by the castle walls
[Refrain: Ren√©]
Gotta steal from the rich when they don't know I'm comin'
Gotta give to the poor, no time for lovin'
My oh my, don't you cry 'cause there's no way I'm stayin'
I will leave, say bye-bye, I'm goin' my way
[Chorus: Lene]
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To have the kingdom, baby, tell me why
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye?
To rule the country, baby, you and I
