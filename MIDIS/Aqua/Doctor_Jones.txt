Doctor Jones Lyrics
[Intro: Lene]
Sometimes the feelin' is right
You fall in love for the first time
Heartbeat and kisses so sweet
Summertime love in the moonlight
[Refrain: Lene]
Ah-yippie-yi-ooh, ah-yippie-yi-yeah
Ah-yippie-yi-ooh-ah
[Verse 1: Lene]
Now that summer is gone
You have to go back home
Please come and see me again
I never felt more alone
[Pre-Chorus: Lene, 
Ren√©
]
Baby, I am missin' you
I want you by my side
And I hope you'll miss me too
Come back and stay
I'll think about you every day
I really want you too
You swept my feet right off the ground
You're the love I found
