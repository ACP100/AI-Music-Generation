[Verse 1]
She ain't got no money
Her clothes are kinda funny
Her hair is kinda wild and free
Oh, but love grows

And it's working so well
That I can't get away
[Verse 3]
I'm a lucky fella
And I just got to tell her
That I love her endlessly
Because love grows
Where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me
