Ibiza Lyrics
This old town is mighty cold
No-one laughs a lot
All my stories have been told
And some ain't worth a jot
Got to get away from here
Find myself some fun
Gonna take the next plain out
And fly into the sun
So we're flying away to Ibiza
Takin' a plain to Ibiza
Seein' my sweet senorita
(I'm waiting for my senor)
Goin' again to Ibiza
Can't wait to be there once more
I learned of love, the sun up above
Ibiza, senor, por vavor
Tired of this old city life
Man it's getting rough
Sick of all this nine to five
I've really had enough
Seems my life is full of rose
Overdue for hice
Got to ride that big wifeherd
Into those sunny skies
