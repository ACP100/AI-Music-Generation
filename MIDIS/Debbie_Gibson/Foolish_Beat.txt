Foolish Beat Lyrics
Foolish Beat topped the Billboard Hot 100 for a week in June of 1988 which made Debbie Gibson the youngest person to not only sing a number-one hit, but write & produce it as well.
[Verse 1]
There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four leaf clover
But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you
[Chorus]
I could never love again the way that I loved you
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart
[Verse 2]
When I was sorry
It was too late to turn around
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart
