One Hand, One Heart Lyrics
“One Hand, One Heart” was released as the third single from the album and it also failed to make any music charts at all.
[Verse 1:]
Come with me
To a place where all is free
No one to tell you what to do
How to tell me your feelings
Just pure honesty
I know that
If we were given space
Baby
We'd find our place together
But people get in the way
Cause they don't understand
[Chorus:]
All alone
I want to be
All alone
Sharing my heart
My home in your arms
All alone
No people and no telephone
Just you and I
One hand, one heart
