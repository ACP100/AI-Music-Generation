Tell It Like It Is Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby, my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy
[Verse 2]
If you are serious
Don't play with my heart, it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then baby, I will, girl, you know I will
[Chorus]
Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed, let your conscience be your guide
But I know deep down inside of me
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride
[Verse 3]
Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby, go on and live
[Chorus]
Tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with, go and find yourself a toy
But I'll tell it like it is
My time is too expensive and I'm not your little boy
Mm, tell it like it is
