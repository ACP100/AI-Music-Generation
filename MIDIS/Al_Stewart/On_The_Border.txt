On the Border Lyrics
[Chorus]
The fishing boats go out across the evening water
Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud, the ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border
[Verse 1]
On my wall the colours of the maps are running
From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night, the hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border
[Verse 2]
In the village where I grew up nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
And no-one notices the customs slip away
[Verse 3]
Late last night the rain was knocking on my window
I moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow
I thought I saw down in the street the spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing on the border
[Verse 4]
In the islands where I grew up nothing seems the same
It's just the patterns that remain
An empty shell
But there's a strangeness in the air, you feel too well
