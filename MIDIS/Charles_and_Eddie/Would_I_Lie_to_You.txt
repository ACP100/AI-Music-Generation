Would I Lie To You? Lyrics
[Intro]
No, no, no, baby
Mhm-mmm
La-la-la-la-la-la (Look into my eyes)
Would I lie to you, yeah? (Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)
[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? Come on
[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to know the truth
In my arms is the only proof
I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door
Now it's open, I can't do no more
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (Oh-oh, oh)
[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? Come on (Would I lie to you?)
