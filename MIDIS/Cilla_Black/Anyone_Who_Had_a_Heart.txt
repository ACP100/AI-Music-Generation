Anyone Who Had a Heart Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Anyone who ever loved, could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed, could look at me
And know I dream of you
Knowing I love you so
[Chorus]
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me, too, fool
Couldn't be another heart that hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do?
[Verse 2]
Every time you go away, I always say
This time it's goodbye, dear
Loving you the way I do
I take you back, without you I'd die, dear
Knowing I love you so
[Chorus]
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me, too, fool
Couldn't be another heart that hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do?
