[Intro: Michael McCary]
Girl, you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playin' with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever, baby, you just see
[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart

Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me

Girl, each time I try, I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around
[Chorus: All]
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still, I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still, I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
