Love and Mercy Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was sittin' in a crummy movie with my hands on my chin
Oh, the violence that occurs, seems like we never win
[Chorus]
Love and mercy, that's what you need tonight
So love and mercy to you and your friends tonight
[Verse 2]
I was lyin' in my room and the news came on TV
A lotta people out there hurtin' and it really scares me
[Chorus]
Love and mercy, that's what you need tonight
So love and mercy to you and your friends tonight
[Verse 3]
I was standin' in a bar and watchin' all the people there
Oh, the loneliness in this world, well, it's just not fair
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Hey, love and mercy, that's what you need tonight
So love and mercy to you and your friends tonight
Love and mercy, that's what you need tonight
