Jamminâ€™ (Remix) Lyrics
[Intro] [MC Lyte]
This struggle continues (x2)
[Chorus]
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I want to jam it with you
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I hope you like jamming too
[Bob Marley]
There is no rules, there is no vows we could do it anyhow
I and I will see you through
Because everyday we pay the price, 
with a living sacrifice
Jamming until the jam is through
We jamming, to think that jamming was a thing of the past
We jamming and I hope the jam is going to last
No bullet could stop us now, we neither beg nor we won't bow
Neither can't be bought nor sold
We all defend the right, Jah, Jah children must unite
Whose life is worth much more than gold
[Chorus]
Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And rules all creation
