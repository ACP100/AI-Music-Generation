Exodus Lyrics
[Intro]
Exodus, Movement of Jah people, oh, yeah
Heaven will tell to let me tell you this
[Verse 1]
Men and people will fight ya down, tell me why
(When you see Jah light) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Let me tell you if you're not wrong; then, why?
(Everything is alright)
So we gonna walk, alright
Through the roads of creation
We the generation, tell me why
(Trod through great tribulation) Trod through great tribulation
[Chorus]
Exodus, alright, Movement of Jah people
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, alright
Exodus, Movement of Jah people, oh, hell
[Verse 2]
Yeah-yeah-yeah, well
Uh, open your eyes (And look within)
Are you satisfied? (With the life you're livin'?) Uh
We know where we're goin', uh
We know where we're from
We're leavin' Babylon
We're goin' to our Fatherland
