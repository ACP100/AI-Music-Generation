[Chorus]
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh, no, oh
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Yeah, all around in my home town
They're trying to track me down, yeah
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say
Oh, now, now, oh
[Chorus]
I shot the sheriff
, the sheriff
But I swear it was in self-defense
, oh no
Ooh, ooh, ooh
, yeah
I say, I shot the sheriff, oh, Lord
And they say it is a capital 
offense
, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
, yeah
[Verse 2]
Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what, I don't know
Every time I plant a seed
He said kill it before it grow
He said kill them before they grow
And so, and so
Read it in the news
