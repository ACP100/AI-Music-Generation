[Verse 2: Buck Dharma]
Valentine is done
Here, but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity
 
(Romeo and Juliet)

[Chorus: Buck Dharma]
(We can be like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
