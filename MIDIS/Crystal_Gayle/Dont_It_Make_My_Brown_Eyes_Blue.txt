Don’t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue Lyrics
Worldwide hit single from the 1977 album We Must Believe in Magic

The song was recognized by ASCAP as one of the ten most-performed songs of the 20th century.
Don't know when I've been so blue
Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new
And don't it make my brown eyes blue
I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long, say it isn't true
And don't it make my brown eyes blue
Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Give me no reasons, give me alibis
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye
I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do
And don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
