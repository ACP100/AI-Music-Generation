Devil Woman Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw that cat at my door
So I came in to you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call
[Pre-Chorus]
Crystal ball on the table
Showin' the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast
 (Uh)
[Chorus]
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind
[Verse 2]
"Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me a tall, dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned"
