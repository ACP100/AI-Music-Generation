Some People Lyrics
Some people they tease one another
Take pride in themselves
Keeping the other one down
Well, I'm not like that at all
Some people they hurt one another
They love to see
Hurt in the other one's eyes
Well, I'm not like that at all
Some people are born for each other
They love to walk
Holding the other one's hand
They always understand!
Some people cry
Some people know why
Ohoho
Ahaha
Some people they use one another
So aimlessly
Not like lovers do
Well, I'm not like that at all
