Beginnings Lyrics
[Verse 1: Robert Lamm]
When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are
Or what we're doing, I'm with you, that's all that matters
Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing
I wish I could sing it to you, oh no
I wish I could sing it to you
[Chorus: Robert Lamm, 
with bandmates
]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Mostly I'm silent
Mmm, silent la la la la la
Never think of bad words to say
[Verse 2: Robert Lamm]
When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings
The color of chills all over my body
And when I feel them, I quickly try to decide which one
I should try to put into words, oh no
Try to put into words
[Chorus: Robert Lamm, 
with bandmates
]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Mostly I'm silent
Silent la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Silent
