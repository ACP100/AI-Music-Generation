Here is Where We Begin Lyrics
[Verse 1: Bill Champlin]
Most of my life
I was living without you...
Something always seemed so incomplete
Through the years
I was thinking about you...
Waiting for the moment we would meet
[Pre-Chorus: Bill Champlin]
How do you do?
Good to see you!
What are your thoughts?
Did you need to...
Had so long 'til the feeling...
Something was wrong...
[Chorus: All]
(There are no) Here is where we begin
Its all very clear...
For this is the end
Of being alone
We've waited so long...
We'll make it forever
[Verse 2: Bill Champlin]
Nights I would dream
Of the day we made contact
Its come true
Now I'm standing at your door
After a time did you come to forget me?
Here I am
Now I'm standing at your door
