Hard to Say Iâ€™m Sorry (Single Edit Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Peter Cetera, 
with bandmates
]
"Everybody needs a little time away"
I heard her say, 
from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away, from each other
[Pre-Chorus: All]
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay
[Chorus: All]
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go
[Verse 2: Peter Cetera, 
with bandmates
]
Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day, from your body
Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away, from the one that I love
[Pre-Chorus: All]
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go
