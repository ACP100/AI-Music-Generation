Hard Habit to Break Lyrics
[Verse 1: Peter Cetera]
I guess I thought you'd be here
Forever
Another illusion
I chose to create
You don't know what you got
Until it's gone
And I found out
A little too late
[Verse 2: Bill Champlin, 
with bandmates
]
I was acting as if
You were lucky to have me
Doing you a favor
I hardly knew you were there
But then you were gone
And it all was wrong
Had no idea how much I cared
[Chorus: Peter Cetera, 
with bandmates
, 
Bill Champlin
]
Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to
Being without you
It's all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you, babe
You're a hard habit to break
