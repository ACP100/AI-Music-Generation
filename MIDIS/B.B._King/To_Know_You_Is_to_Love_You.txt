To Know You Is to Love You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
To know you is to love you
But to know me is not that way, you see
'Cause you made me so happy
That my love for you grows endlessly
[Refrain]
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
[Verse 2]
Baby, to know you is to love you
You smile when I see your face
'Cause there ain't no one on this earth
Baby, could ever, ever take your place
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
