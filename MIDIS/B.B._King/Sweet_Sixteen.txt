Sweet Sixteen Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
Yes, when I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
You just left your home then, woman
Ah, the sweetest thing I'd ever seen
[Verse 2]
But you wouldn't do nothing, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked you to
Yes, you wouldn't do nothing, baby
Oh, you wouldn't do anything I asked to
You know you ran away from your home, baby
And now you wanna run away from old B. too
[Verse 3]
You know I loved you
I loved you before I could call your name
Oh, you know I loved you, baby
Baby I loved you, I loved you before I could call your name
Well, it seems like everything I do now, baby
Everything I do is in vain
[Verse 4]
My brother's in Korea, baby
Sister's down in New Orleans
Yes, brother's in Korea, baby
Lord, sister, sister's down in New Orleans
Well, you know I'm having so much trouble, woman
Baby, I wonder what in the world is gonna happen to me
