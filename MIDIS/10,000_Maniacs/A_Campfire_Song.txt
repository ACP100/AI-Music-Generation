A Campfire Song Lyrics
[Verse 1: Natalie Merchant]
A lie to say, "o, my mountain has coal veins and beds to dig
500 men with axes and they all dig for me"
A lie to say, "o, my river where many fish do swim
Half of the catch is mine when you haul your nets in"
[Chorus: Natalie Merchant]
Never will he believe that his greed is a blinding ray
No devil or redeemer will cheat him
He'll take his gold to where he's lying cold
[Verse 2: Natalie Merchant]
A lie to say, "o, my mine gave a diamond as big as a fist"
But with every gem in his pocket, the jewels he has missed
A lie to say, "o, my garden is growing taller by the day"
He only eats the best and tosses the rest away
[Chorus: Natalie Merchant]
Never will he be believe that his greed is a blinding ray
No devil or redeemer can cheat him
He'll take his gold to where he's lying cold
Six deep in the grave
[Bridge: Natalie Merchant, 
Michael Stipe
]
His oldest pain and fear in life
There'll not be time
His oldest pain and fear in life
There'll not be time
Hey hey
Nor can he buy
