Youâ€™ve Made Me So Very Happy Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I lost at love before
Got mad and closed the door
But you said try just once more
[Pre-Chorus]
I chose you for the one
Now we're havin' so much fun
You treated me so kind
I'm about to lose my mind
[Chorus]
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
[Verse 2]
The others were untrue
But when it came to lovin' you
I'd spend my whole life with you
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you came and you took control
You touch my very soul
You always show me that
Lovin' you is where it's at
