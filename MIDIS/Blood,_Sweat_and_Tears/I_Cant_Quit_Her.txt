I Canâ€™t Quit Her Lyrics
[Intro]
[Verse 1]
I can't quit her
She's got a hold on me
She got her hand on my soul
I can't quit her
Cause I see her face everywhere I go
[Chorus 1]
In the city streets, in the country fields
In the back of my mind
I know it can't be real
For a woman to possess
All the tenderness she had
But the hands of time
Keep tickin' on my back
Cause it's been so long
Since I had her back beside me
Yeah, I know
[Verse 2]
I can't quit her
Cause on my darkest night
She comes on like a light
I can't quite her
Try as I may, with all my might
She had a woman's touch
And a young girls eyes
And in seconds flat I was pros'lytized
Turned around
And made to feel sweet love
But the hands of time
Keep tickin' on my back
Cause it's been so long
Since I had her back beside me
