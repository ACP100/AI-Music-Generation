Sometimes in Winter Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Sometimes in Winter
I gaze into the streets
And walk through snow and city sleet
Behind your room
[Verse 2]
Sometimes in Winter
Forgotten memories
Remember you behind the trees
With leaves that cried
[Chorus]
By the window once I waited for you
Laughing slightly you would run
Trees alone would shield us in the meadow
Makin' love in the evening sun
[Bridge]
Now you're gone, girl
And the lamp posts call your name
I can hear them
In the spring of frozen rain
Now you're gone, girl
And the time's slowed down till dawn
It's a cold room and the walls ask
Where you've gone
