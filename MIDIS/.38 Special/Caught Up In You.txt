Caught Up In You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I never knew there'd come a day
When I'd be sayin' to you
"Don't let this good love slip away
Now that we know that it's true"
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't, don't you know the kind of man I am?
No, said I'd never fall in love again
But it's real, and the feeling comes shining through
[Chorus]
I'm so caught up in you, little girl
And I never did suspect a thing
So caught up in you, little girl
That I never wanna get myself free
And baby, it's true, you're the one
Who caught me, baby, you taught me
How good it could be
[Verse 2]
It took so long to change my mind
I thought that love was a game
I played around enough to find
No two are ever the same
