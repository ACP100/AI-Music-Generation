Youâ€™re the First, the Last, My Everything Lyrics
[Intro]
We got it together, didn't we?
We've definitely got our thing together, don't we, baby?
Isn't that nice?
I mean, really, when you really sit and think about it, isn't it really, really nice?
I can easily feel myself slipping more and more ways
That super world of my own
Nobody but you and me
We've got it together, baby
Oh, oh
[Verse 1]
The first, my last, my everything
And the answer to all my dreams
You're my sun (Sun), my moon (Moon), my guiding star
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are
[Chorus]
I know there's 
only, only one
 like you
There's no way they could have made two
You're you're all I'm living for
Your love, I'll keep forevermore
(You're the first) You're the first (The last), you're the last, my everything
[Verse 2]
In you, I found so many things
A love so new only you could bring
(Can't you see it's you, you, you?) Can't you see it's you? You make me feel this way
You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day
