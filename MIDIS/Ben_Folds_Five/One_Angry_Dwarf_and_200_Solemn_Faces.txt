[Verse 1]
September '75
I was 47 inches high
My mom said by Christmas I would have
A badass mother GI Joe
For your little minds to blow
I still got beat up after class
[Chorus]
Yeah, now I'm big and important
One angry dwarf and 200 solemn faces are you

Jane, remember second grade?
Said you couldn't stand my face
Rather than kiss me, you said you'd rather die
[Chorus]
I'm big and important
One angry dwarf and 200 solemn faces are you
If you really want to see me
Check the papers and the TV
Look who's tellin' who what to do
No, kiss my ass goodbye
