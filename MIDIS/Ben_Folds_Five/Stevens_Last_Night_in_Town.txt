[Verse 1]
Everyone gather round now, sing us a song
Just in case by tomorrow it happens he's gone
For two weeks and seven days our fair foreign friend
I have this feeling we might never see Steven again
[Chorus]
But we thought he was gone
And now he's come back again
Last week it was funny
And now the joke's wearing thin
Cause everyone knows now, that every night now
Will be Steven's last night in town
[Verse 2]
He's charmed everyone here, except Tamara Easter
Who later revealed to him her innermost secrets
Won us over with stories about Linda McCartney
Lost points with the ladies for saying he couldn't
Love a woman with cellulite
[Chorus]
But we thought he was gone
And now he's come back again
Last week it was funny
And now the joke's wearing thin
Cause everyone knows now, that every night now
Will be Steven's last night in town
