Your Uncle Walter's going on and on
Bout everything he's seen and done
The voice of 50 years experience
He's drunk watching the television
You know he's been around the world
Last night he flew to Baghdad in his magical armchair
Cigarettes and a six pack, he just got back
Now the spit's flying everywhere
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Your Uncle Walter's going on and on)
You're back so late (Where did you go that you were gone so long?)
How could you leave me here so long
With Uncle Walter?
Your Uncle Walter saw who fired the shots
He drove his chair in the cavalcade
He's flown from South Africa to countries where
They beat themselves on the backs with chains
There was a fleet of battleships
And one reclining chair
Headed north on the Arabian sea
Now he's back to he'll tell us what
He and his oldest boy Blair
They're getting rich with their mail order scheme
