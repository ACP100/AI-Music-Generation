Missing the War Lyrics
“Missing the War” references an emotionally-unsatisfied man and his unsuccessful efforts to build up the courage to leave his partner.
[Verse 1]
All is quiet. His tired eyes
See figures jotted down
And clothes all strewn around the bedroom floor
Now nothing's adding up
And nothing's making sense
She's sleeping like a baby
She doesn't know he wasn't meant for this
[Chorus]
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war all night
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war all night
I'm missing the war
[Verse 2]
He drove home again, pissed and beaten
It's really no big deal
It happens all the time, it's no big deal
[Chorus]
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war, oh my
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war
I'm missing the war, oh my
I'm missing the war
