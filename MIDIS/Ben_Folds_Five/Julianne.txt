Julianne Lyrics
The song “Julianne” was written to make fun of the classic 90s grunge songs that talked about failed relationships and the denial at the pain he feels, even though he “doesn’t miss Julianne.”
[Verse 1]
I met this girl, she looked like Axl Rose
Got drunk and took her home and we slept in our clothes
And in the morning, put my feet on the floor and thought:
"Being awake never felt like this before"
[Verse 2]
And Julianne, you know she wouldn't approve
Talked all day on the phone 'cause I had nothing to do
Got rid of Axl by the afternoon
Being awake never felt so clear and blue
[Chorus]
That's all I knew
Guess that I was innocent too
I sing a song, yeah, and it won't be the blues
'Cause I don't miss Julianne
[Verse 3]
My friend, she told me she felt sorry for me
She said the truth would come crashing down on me
That I'd feel sorry but the truth of it is
That I feel guilty for not giving a sh-
[Chorus]
That's all I knew
Guess that I was innocent too
I'll sing a song, yeah, and it won't be the blues
'Cause I don't miss Julianne
