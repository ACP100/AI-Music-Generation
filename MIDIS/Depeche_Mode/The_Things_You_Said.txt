The Things You Said Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I heard it from my friends about the things you said
I heard it from my friends about the things you said
But they know me better than that
They know me better than that
They know my weaknesses
(I never tried to hide them)
They know my weaknesses
(I never denied them)
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
I heard it from my friends about the things you said
I heard it from my friends about the things you said
How can a view become so twisted?
How can a view become so twisted?
They know my weaknesses
(I never tried to hide them)
They know my weaknesses
(You tried them)
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
I get so carried away
You brought me down to earth
I thought we had something precious
Now I know what itâ€™s worth
