Ice Machine Lyrics
A early demo version of this song do have a chorus that is:

“The ice machine, ice machine”
[Verse 1]
Running through my head secretly
The shouts of the boys in the factory
I ring you on the telephone silently
Like blood, like the wine in the darkroom scene
[Chorus]
The darkroom scene
Darkroom scene
[Verse 2]
A letter, once composed
Seven years long and as tall as a tree
Reading on the wall
Emissions, efficiency
[Chorus]
Efficiency
Efficiency
[Bridge]
Resurrect
As a feeling
On my window
Of a past reunion
