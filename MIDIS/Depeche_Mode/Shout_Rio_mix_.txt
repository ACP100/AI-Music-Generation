Shout! (Rio Mix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She was silent, trying to be
Like the girl who acted on the TV
Always knowing when to say
Wishing for a moment so that they could see
[Pre-Chorus]
Staring in the night
A picture in my room
And I think that she knew her lines
[Chorus]
Break away tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We've got to get it right
We've got to understand
[Verse 2]
Carefully watching waiting
As I stood upon the back streets and we start to play
I was screaming louder
As the curtains fall between us in a twisted way
[Pre-Chorus]
Staring in the night
A picture in my room
And I think that she knew her lines
