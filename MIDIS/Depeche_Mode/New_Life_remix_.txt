New Life (Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I stand still, stepping on the shady streets
And I watched that man to a stranger
You think you only know me when you turn on the light
Now the room is lit red danger
[Chorus]
Complicating, circulating
New life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life
[Verse 2]
Transition to another place
So the time will pass more slowly
Your features fuse and your shadow's red
Like a film I've seen, now show me
[Chorus]
Complicating, circulating
New life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life
[Verse 3]
Your face is hidden and we're out of sight
And the road just leads to nowhere
The stranger in the door is the same as before
So the question answer's nowhere
