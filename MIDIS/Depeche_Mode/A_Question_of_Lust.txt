A Question of Lust Lyrics
“A Question Of Lust” is Depeche Mode’s 16th single and the 3rd track on the album Black Celebration.

It is the 1st track on the album to be sung by Martin Gore.
[Verse 1]
Fragile, like a baby in your arms
Be gentle with me, I'd never willingly do you harm
Apologies are all you seem to get from me
But just like a child, you make me smile when you care for me
And you know
[Chorus]
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
[Verse 2]
Independence is still important for us, though
(We realise)
It's easy to make the stupid mistake of letting go
(Do you know what I mean?)
My weaknesses, you know each and every one
(It frightens me)
But I need to drink more than you seem to think before I'm anyone's
And you know
[Chorus]
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
