Black Celebration Lyrics
[Chorus]
Let's have a black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight
[Post-Chorus]
To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day
[Verse 1]
I look to you, how you carry on
When all hope is gone, can't you see?
Your optimistic eyes seem like paradise
To someone like me
[Pre-Chorus]
I want to take you in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
[Chorus]
Black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight
[Post-Chorus]
To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day
