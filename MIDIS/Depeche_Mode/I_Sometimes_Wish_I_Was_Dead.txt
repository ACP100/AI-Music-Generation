I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead Lyrics
[Verse 1]
New sound all around, you can hear it too
Getting hot, never stop, just for me and you
Playing on my radio
And saying that you had to go
[Verse 2]
New day, turn away, wipe away the tear
New night, feel alright, knowing that you’re here
Dancing with you all the time
And don't you think that it’s a crime
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Backstreet, never meet, never say goodbye
I know where to go, but I don’t know why
You say that it’s from above
And I say this is modern love
