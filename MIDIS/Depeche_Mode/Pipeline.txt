Pipeline Lyrics
“Pipeline” is the 3rd track on the album “Construction Time Again”.

The whole song is made of sounds from an abandoned building site in London.
[Verse 1]
Get out the crane, construction time again
What is it this time?
We're laying a pipeline
Let the beads of sweat flow till the ends have met though
Could take a long time
Working on the pipeline
[Chorus]
Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
On this golden day, work's been sent our way
That could last a lifetime
Working on the pipeline
From the heart of our land to the mouth of the man
Must reach him sometime
We're laying a pipeline
[Chorus]
Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy
