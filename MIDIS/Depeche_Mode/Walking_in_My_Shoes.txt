Walking in My Shoes Lyrics
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
I would tell you about the things they put me through
The pain I've been subjected to
But the Lord himself would blush
The countless feasts laid at my feet
Forbidden fruits for me to eat
But I think your pulse would start to rush
[Pre-Chorus 1: Dave Gahan 
& Martin L. Gore
]
Now I'm
 not looking for absolution
Forg
iveness for the things I do
But 
before you come to any conclusions
Try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
[Chorus 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
You'll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my shoes
[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
Morality would frown upon
Decency look down upon
The scapegoat fate's made of me
But I promise now, my judge and jurors
My intentions couldn't have been purer
My case is easy to see
