[Intro: Dave Gahan]
Can you feel a little love?
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
As your boney fingers close around me
Long and spindly, death becomes me
Heaven, can you see what I see?
Hey, you pale and sickly child
You're death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile

Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're given, mmh

Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it's educating
Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without, it lives within you
[Refrain: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Feel the fever coming
You're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won't stop you itching
