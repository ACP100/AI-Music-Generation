Only Sixteen Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She was only sixteen, only sixteen
But I loved her so
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
[Verse 2]
We'd laugh and we'd sing, and do funny things
And it made our hearts glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
[Chorus]
So why did I give my heart so fast, it never will happen again
But I was a mere child of sixteen, I've aged a year since then
[Verse 3]
She was only sixteen, only sixteen
Ooh with eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
[Chorus]
So why did I give my heart so fast, it never will happen again
But I was a mere child of sixteen, I've aged a year since then
