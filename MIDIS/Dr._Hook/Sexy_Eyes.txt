[Verse 1]
I was sitting all alone
Watching people get it on, with each other
They were dancing 'cross the floor
Turning movement back and forth, they were lovers
One more lonely night for me
I looked up, what did I see?
[Chorus]
Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor
Couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you
I wanna move with you, sexy eyes

Ooh, your magic cast a spell
It didn't take long 'til we fell, and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me
This is how it's gonna be
[Chorus]
Sexy eyes moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, gettin' down with you
I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, gettin' down with you
I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
