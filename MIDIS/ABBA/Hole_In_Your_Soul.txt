Hole in Your Soul Lyrics
[Verse 1: Agnetha, Frida & 
Björn
]
You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden, way down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst 
(And when you're feeling so bad)
And you think you're cursed 
(And you've got it sad)
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose
[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
It's gotta be rock 'n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock 'n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul
[Verse 2: Agnetha, Frida & 
Björn
]
My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool
But on all weekends 
(Together again)
When I meet my friends 
(I'm gonna see them now)
And we're looking 'round for the action, we sure play it cool
[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
It's gotta be rock 'n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock 'n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul
