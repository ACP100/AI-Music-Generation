Summer Night City [Full-Length Version] Lyrics
[Intro: Björn]
End of night, a new day dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on a beach
[Hook: Björn and 
Agentha, Björn, Benny & Frida
]
Summer night city
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city
[Verse 1: Agentha & Frida]
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
[Pre-Chorus 1: Björn and 
Agentha, Björn, Benny & Frida
]
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free
