Rock Me Lyrics
[Chorus]
Rock me, give me that kick now
Rock me, show me that trick now
Roll me, you can do magic
Baby, and I can't get enough of it
Rock me, give me that feeling
Roll me, rocking and reeling
Baby, so don't stop doing it, don't stop doing it, now
[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop the rocking
Don't stop the rocking
I said don't stop the rocking
[Verse 1]
Wanna be, wanna be in my baby's arms
Gonna be, gonna be
Nice and gentle if you want me to
Just as long as I'm in love with you
Yours forever, honey, that's what I
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, yeah
[Chorus]
Rock me, give me that kick now
Rock me, show me that trick now
Roll me, you can do magic
Baby, and I can't get enough of it
Rock me, give me that feeling
Roll me, rocking and reeling
Baby, so don't stop doing it, don't stop doing it, now
