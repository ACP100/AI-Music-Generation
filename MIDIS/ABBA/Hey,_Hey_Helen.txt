Hey, Hey Helen Lyrics
[Verse 1]
So at last, you're free
It's the way you wanted it to be
And the price you paid
To become a woman of today
[Pre-Chorus]
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry?
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy?
[Chorus]
Hey, hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen
Can you make it alone? (Yes, you can)
[Verse 2]
So you're free at last 
(Pretty woman)
And beginning to forget the past 
(Lucky woman)
Does it make you sad 
(Being lonely?)
When you think about the life you ha-ha-had?
[Pre-Chorus]
But you're right, you had to take a second chance
So you fight to find your freedom
