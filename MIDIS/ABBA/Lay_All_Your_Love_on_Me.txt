[Verse 1]
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you
[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear
