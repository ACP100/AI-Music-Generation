[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida, 
Benny & Björn
]

(Take a chance, take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
Honey, I'm still free; take a chance on me
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance, take a chance)
(Take a chance, take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
Honey, I'm still free; take a chance on me
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
[Post-Chorus: Agnetha & Frida, 
Agnetha
]
Take a chance on me
That's all I ask of you honey
Take a chance on me
