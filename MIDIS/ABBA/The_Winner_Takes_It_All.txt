The Winner Takes It All Lyrics
‘The Winner Takes it All’ is a single off the album Super Trouper.

With long running vocal on the back, the song sounds much more vivid.
[Verse 1: Agnetha Fältskog]
I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play
[Chorus: Agnetha Fältskog]
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny
[Verse 2: Agnetha Fältskog]
I was in your arms, thinkin' I belonged there
I figured it made sense building me a fence
Building me a home
, thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules
[Chorus: Agnetha Fältskog & 
Anni-Frid Lingstad
]
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (
Takes it all
)
The loser has to fall (
Has to fall
)
It's simple and it's plain (
Yes, it's plain
)
Why should I complain? (
Why complain?
)
