Tiger Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The city is a jungle, you'd better take care
Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe me, you'd better beware
Of me
[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger
[Verse 2]
The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner, and try not to scream
It's me
[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger
[Post-Chorus]
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
