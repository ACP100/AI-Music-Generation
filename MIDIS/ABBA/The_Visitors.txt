The Visitors Lyrics
“The Visitors” is the title track from ABBA’s final studio album, released in 1981.
[Verse 1]
I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me
[Verse 2]
The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling
[Chorus]
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up
