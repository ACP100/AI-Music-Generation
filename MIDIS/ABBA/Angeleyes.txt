[Refrain]
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
I keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
I keep thinking, ah
[Verse 1]
Last night, I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
'Cause he always used to look at me that way
And I thought, maybe I should walk right up to her and say
"Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play"
[Chorus]
Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day, you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
Oh no, no, no, no
