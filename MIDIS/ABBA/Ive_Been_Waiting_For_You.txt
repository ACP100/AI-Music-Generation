Iâ€™ve Been Waiting for You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I, I've been in love before
I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
Still, strange as it seems to me
You brought it back to me
That old feeling
[Verse 2]
I, I don't know what you do
You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think you'll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
And you ease me
[Chorus]
You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I've laid my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
