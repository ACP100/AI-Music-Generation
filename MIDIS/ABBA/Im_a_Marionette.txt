Iâ€™m a Marionette Lyrics
[Verse 1: Agnetha & Frida]
"You're so free," that's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward-bound, pushed around refugee
Something's wrong, got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I had come from outer space, out of place, like King Kong
[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, round and round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown
[Verse 2: Agnetha & Frida]
Like a doll, like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk, how to walk, how to fall
[Interlude]
[Verse 3: Agnetha & Frida]
Can't complain, I've got no-one but myself to blame
Something's happening I can't control, lost my hold, it's insane
[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, round and round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown
