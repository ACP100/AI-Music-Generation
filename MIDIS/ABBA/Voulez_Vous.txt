Voulez-Vous Lyrics
Voulez-Vous means “Do You Want” in French, and is typically used suggestively in English.

The song was released in 1979 in Stockholm. It is a vibrant strong rock pop record.
[Verse 1]
People everywhere
A sense of expectation hangin' in the air
Givin' out a spark
Across the room, your eyes are glowin' in the dark
[Pre-Chorus]
And here we go again
We know the start, we know the end
Masters of the scene
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean
[Chorus]
Voulez-vous?
 (Ah-ha)
Take it now or leave it (Ah-ha)
Now is all we get (Ah-ha)
Nothing promised, no regrets
Voulez-vous? (Ah-ha)
Ain't no big decision (Ah-ha)
You know what to do (Ah-ha)
La question c'est «Voulez-vous?»
Voulez-vous?
[Verse 2]
I know what you think
The girl means business, so I'll offer her a drink
Lookin' mighty proud
I see you leave your table, pushin' through the crowd
