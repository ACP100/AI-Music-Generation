Ride Like the Wind Lyrics
[Intro]
To be, to be free again
To be, to be free again
To be, to be free again
To be, to be free again
(I'll set you free)
(I'll set you free)
(I'll set you free)
(I'll set you free)
[Verse 1]
I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind
[Pre-Chorus]
And I got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
[Chorus]
Ride like the wind
To be, to be free again
Ride like the wind
To be, to be free again
Ride like the wind
To be, to be free again
Ride like the wind
To be, to be free again
