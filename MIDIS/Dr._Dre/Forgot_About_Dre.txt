[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me, 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-Gs
And the group that said, "Motherfuck the police"
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me
