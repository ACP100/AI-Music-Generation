Stormy Lyrics
[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
You were the sunshine, baby, whenever you smiled
But I call you Stormy today
All of a sudden that ol' rain's fallin' down
And my world is cloudy and gray
You've gone away
[Chorus]
Oh, Stormy, oh, Stormy
Bring back that sunny day
[Verse 2]
Yesterday's love was like a warm summer breeze
But, like the weather, ya changed
Now things are dreary, baby
And it's windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain
Callin' your name
[Chorus]
Oh, Stormy, oh, Stormy
Bring back that sunny day
