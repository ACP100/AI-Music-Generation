Joining You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Dear daughter, your mom, my friend
Left a message on my machine
She was frantic, saying you were talking crazy
[Verse 2]
That you wanted to do away with yourself
I guess she thought I'd be a perfect resort
'Cause we've had this inexplicable connection since our youth
[Verse 3]
And yes, they're in shock, they are panicked
You and your chronic, them and their drama
You, this embarrassment, us in the middle of this delusion
[Chorus]
If we were our bodies
If we were our futures
If we were our defenses
I'd be joining you
If we were our culture
If we were our leaders
If we were our denials
I'd be joining you
[Verse 4]
I remember vividly a day years ago, we were camping
You knew more than you thought you should know
You said I don't want ever to be brainwashed
