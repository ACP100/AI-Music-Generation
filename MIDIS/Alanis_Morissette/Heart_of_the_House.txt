Heart of the House Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You are the original template
You are the original exemplary
How seen were you actually?
How revered were you, honestly, at the time?
[Verse 2]
Why, pleased with your low maintenance
You loved us more than we could've loved you back
Where was your ally
Your partner in feminine crime?
[Chorus]
Oh ho, mother, who's your buddy?
Oh ho, mother, who's got your back?
The heart of the house
The heart of the house
All hail the goddess
[Verse 3]
You were "good ol'"
You were "count on her till four a.m."
You saw me run from the house
In the snow melodramatically
[Chorus]
Oh ho, mother, who's your sister?
Oh ho, mother, who's your friend?
The heart of the house
The heart of that house
All hail the goddess
