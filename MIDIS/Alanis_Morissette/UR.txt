UR Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Burn the books
They've got too many names and psychoses
All this incriminating evidence would surely haunt me
If someone broke into my house
[Verse 2]
Suits in the living room
Do you realize guys I was born in 1974?
We've got someone here to explain your publishing
We know how much you love to be in front of audiences
[Chorus]
Hopeful you are
Schoolbound you are
Naive you are
Driven you are
[Verse 3]
Take a trip to New York with your guardian
And your fake identification
When they say, "Is there something, anything
You'd like to know, young lady?"
You say, "Yes, I'd like to know what kind of people
I'll be dealing with"
