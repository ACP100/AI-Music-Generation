[Verse 1]
I had no choice but to hear you
You stated your case, time and again
I thought about it
You treat me like I'm a princess
I'm not used to liking that
You ask how my day was
[Chorus]
You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
[Verse 2]
Your love is thick
And it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver
Than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service
[Chorus]
You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
