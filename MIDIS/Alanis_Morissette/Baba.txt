Baba Lyrics
Morissette critiques the quick-fix, self-help, consumerist appropriation of Eastern spirituality by wealthy Westerners.
[Verse 1]
I've seen them kneel with bated breath for their ritual
I've watched this experience raise them to 
pseudo higher levels
I've watched them leave their families in pursuit of your 
nirvana
I've seen them 
coming to line up from Switzerland and America
[Chorus]
How long will this take
, 
baba
?
And how long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me
 hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much will this cost, guru?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?
[Verse 2]
I've seen them give their drugs up in place of makeshift altars
I've heard them chanting 
"Kali Kali"
 
frantically
I've heard them rotely repeat your teachings with elitism
I've seen them boasting robes and 
foreign sandalwood beads
[Chorus]
How long will this take
, 
baba
?
How long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me
 hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much will this cost, guru?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?
