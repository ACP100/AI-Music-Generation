[Verse 1]
I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me

Would she go down on you in a theatre?
Does she speak eloquently?
 
And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died?
 
'Til you died
But you're still alive
[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
[Verse 2]
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr. 
Duplicity
?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinkin' of me when you fuck her?
