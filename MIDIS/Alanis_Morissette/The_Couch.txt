The Couch Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You hadn't seen your father
In such a long time
He died in the arms of his lover
How dare he?
Your mother never left the house
She never married anyone else
You took it upon yourself
To console her
[Verse 2]
You reminded her so much of your father
So you were banished and you
Wonder why you're so hypersensitive
And why you can't trust anyone but us
But then how can I begin to forgive her?
So many years under bridges with dirty water
She was foolish and selfish
And cowardly, if you ask me
[Verse 3]
I don't know where to begin
In all of my fifty odd years
I have been silently suffering and adapting
Perpetuating and enduring
Who are you, younger generation, to tell me
That I have unresolved problems?
Not many examples of fruits of this type of
Excruciating labor
