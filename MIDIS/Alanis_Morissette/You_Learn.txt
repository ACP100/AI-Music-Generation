[Verse 1]
I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone
Yeah, oh
I recommend walkin' around naked in your living room
Yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Swallow it down (What a jagged little pill)
It feels so good (Swimming in your stomach)

[Chorus]
You live, you learn
You love, you learn

You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn

I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time
Feel free
[Pre-Chorus]
Throw it down (The caution blocks you from the wind)
Hold it up (To the rays)
You wait and see when the smoke clears
