Goodbye Lyrics
[Verse 1: Graham Russell]
I can see the pain living in your eyes
And I know how hard you try
You deserve to have so much more
I can feel your heart and I sympathize
And I'll never criticize
All you've ever meant to my life
[Pre-Chorus: Graham Russell]
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to lead you on
I don't want to hold you back
From where you might belong
[Chorus: Russell Hitchcock]
You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to say
But goodbye
[Verse 2: Graham Russell]
You deserve the chance at the kind of love
I'm not sure I'm worthy of
Losing you is painful to me
