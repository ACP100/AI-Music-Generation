Making Love Out of Nothing at All Lyrics
“Making Love Out of Nothing At All” is a power ballad by Australian soft rock band Air Supply for their 1983 Greatest Hits compilation album.

It was released in July 1983.
[Verse 1]
I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie
I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream
And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose
[Verse 2]
And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try
And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game
[Verse 3]
But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Making love out of nothing at all
