Walking on Sunshine Lyrics
Do it, oh, do it
Oh, do it, do it
Oh, do it
Looking through the morning dew
A smoking mountain's nothing new
Lead me to the mountain top
And we'll work until it's time to stop
Oh baby, you're mine, you're mine
You're walking on sunshine
And I got to tell you that you doing fine
Walking on sunshine, oh...
And I got to tell you that you're doing fine
Walking on sunshine
Oh, baby, yeah
Oh, baby, yeah
Oh, baby
Oh, darling
Oh, living isn't everything
But you know the feeling love can bring
I said when you're floating through your cloud
Baby, don't you shout too loud, oh, darling
