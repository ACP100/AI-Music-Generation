Donâ€™t Turn Around Lyrics
[Intro]
Woah, woah, woah, boy
[Verse 1]
If you wanna leave, baby
I won't beg you to stay
And if you wanna go, darlin'
Maybe it's better that way
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna be fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Walk out the door
See if I care
Go on and go now
[Chorus]
But don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breakin'
Don't turn around
I don't want you seein' me cryin'
Just walk away
It's tearin' me apart that you're leavin'
I'm lettin' you go
And I won't let you know
