Shine Lyrics
This song belongs to the 1995â€™s album Rise And Shine Again.
Ooh aah ooh ooh ooh ooh aah
Ooh aah ooh ooh ooh ooh aah
(CHORUS:)
Come on and shine (shine), shine like a star (ah-ha)
Shining so bright (ah-ha) like the star that you are (ah-ha)
Oh oh oh oh shine (shine) into the future (ah-ha)
Spreading your light (ah-ha) wherever you are (ah-ha)
I burn like a fire left in the rain
As I run the race, oh yes I feel the pain
From the resistance I'm feeling the strain
Now the realization is that we are all born the same
(CHORUS)
I reach for the moon and I reach for the stars (ooh ooh ooh)
With the strength from within me yeah, the further and faster I run
Stretching my sinews to the bone (ooh)
Achieving all goals that I seek, I know I must do it alone (ooh ooh ooh)
(BRIDGE:)
When they said I'd never make it
I found strength from within (ooh)
'Cause it is there if you seek it
So you can get it if you really want so
