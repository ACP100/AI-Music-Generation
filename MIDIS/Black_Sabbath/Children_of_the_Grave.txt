[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Revolution in their minds
The children start to march
Against the world
In which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through
Yeah!
[Verse 2]
Children of tomorrow live
In the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow
Bring in peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow
Of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace
Or will they disappear? Yeah!
[Instrumental Break]
