Song Within a Song Lyrics
[Instrumental 0:00 - 1:21]
[Verse 1]
The Sun has left the sky
Now you can close your eyes
Leave all the world behind until tomorrow
[Verse 2]
The dream is like a song
It leads you on and on
The piper plays his tune, so you must follow
[Instrumental 1:48 - 2:38]
[Verse 3]
So far beyond the sky
Not knowing how or why
You realize the feeling is forever
[Verse 4]
And though another day
May steal your dreams away
You and the song will always stay together
[Instrumental 3:06 - 7:12]
