Love Is Everywhere Lyrics
Love is everywhere to you I swear
Can you feel you don't have to be alone
Love is everywhere and I'll be there
Turn around whenever
You need someone
I used to be lonely never played
The game of love
But since I looked into your eyes
You're all I'm thinking of
Now I can't believe it
But this miracle is true
Everywhere I turn my head I can see
No one but you smiling
Faces all around me
Come on and join the ride
Come on, come on
Turn around whenever
You need someone tonight
Baby can you feel my love tonight
Baby can you feel my love tonight
Love is a fire burning
Deep inside your soul
Your emotions running wild
Better let it take control
We got the power
We're the people of today
If we give a little more
We can find a better way
I can't forget the way you kissed me
I want you here tonight
Come on, come on now
Turn around whenever
You need someone tonight
Baby can you feel my love tonight
Love is everywhere
Baby can you feel my love tonight
Can you feel my love around you
Baby can you feel can you feel my love
