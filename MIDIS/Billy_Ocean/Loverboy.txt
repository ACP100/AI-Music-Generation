[Verse 1]
I don't know what you've got
But it plays with my emotions, I want you so much
Darling, I wanna hold you near
Wanna whisper sweet and tender in your ear
Can't stand the thought of you with somebody else
Gotta have your love, gotta have it all to myself
I say yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
[Chorus]
I wanna be your lover, lover, mmm

Baby, you're my dream in motion, and I won't give up
Mmm, teasing me with your fire
My finger's on the trigger
You're the one I desire
'Cause I have this fever feeling from nobody else
Got to have your tenderness all to myself
I say yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
[Chorus]
Wanna be your lover, lover, mmm
Wanna be your lover, lover, lover boy
Lover, lover, yeah
Wanna be your lover, lover, ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah
