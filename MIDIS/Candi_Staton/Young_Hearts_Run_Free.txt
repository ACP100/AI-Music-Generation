Young Hearts Run Free Lyrics
[Verse 1]
What's the sense in sharing this one and only life
Ending up just another lost and lonely wife?
You count up the years
And they will be filled with tears
Love only breaks up to start over again
You'll get the babies
But you won't have your man
While he is busy loving every woman that he can, uh-huh
[Pre-Chorus]
Say I'm gonna leave
A hundred times a day
It's easier said than done
When you just can't break away
(Just can't break away)
[Chorus]
Oh! Young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Oh! Young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you
