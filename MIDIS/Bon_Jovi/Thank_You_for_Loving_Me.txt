Thank You for Loving Me Lyrics
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
It's hard for me to say the things I wanna say sometimes
There's no one here but you and me and that broken old street light
[Pre-Chorus]
Lock the doors, we'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you 
are these five words tonight
[Chorus]
Thank you for lovin' me
For bein' my eyes when I couldn't see
For partin' my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for lovin' me
Thank you for lovin' me
[Verse 2]
I never knew I had a dream until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes, the sky's a different blue
Cross my heart, I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe that you believed my lies
[Chorus]
Thank you for lovin' me
For bein' my eyes when I couldn't see
For partin' my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for lovin' me
Thank you for lovin' me
