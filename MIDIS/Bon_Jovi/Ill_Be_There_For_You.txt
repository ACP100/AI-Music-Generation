I’ll Be There for You Lyrics
[Verse 1: Jon Bon Jovi, 
Jon Bon Jovi & Richie Sambora
]
I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I pray to God you'll give me one more chance, girl
[Chorus: Jon Bon Jovi & Richie Sambora]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you
[Verse 2: Jon Bon Jovi]
I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bon Jovi, 
Riche Sambora
 & 
Both
]
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
And baby, you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your Valen
tine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine, woah
