[Verse 1]
Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know

For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses
[Verse 3]
Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take's on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true
