Runaway Lyrics
[Verse 1]
On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
(All your life) All your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you
But you were livin' in another world, tryna get a message through
[Pre-Chorus]
No one heard a single word you said
They shoulda seen it in your eyes
What was goin' around your head (ooh-ooh)
[Chorus]
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
[Verse 2]
Take a line every night, guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, callin' for a wild time
So you sit home alone, 'cause there's nothin' left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you
[Pre-Chorus]
You know she likes the lights at night on the neon Broadway sign
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find (ooh-ooh)
