[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can
[Chorus]
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain
