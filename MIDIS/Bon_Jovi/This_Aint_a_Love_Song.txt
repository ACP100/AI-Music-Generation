This Ain’t a Love Song Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Shoulda seen it coming when the roses died
Shoulda seen the end of summer in your eyes
Shoulda listened when you said goodnight
You really meant goodbye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees and think you're standin' tall
But only fools are know-it-alls and I played that fool for you
[Pre-Chorus]
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby
[Chorus]
If the love that I've got for you's gone
And if the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
[Verse 2]
Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancin' at the masquerade?
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades and some things never change
