Iâ€™d Die for You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If you could see inside my heart
Then you would understand
I'd never mean to hurt you
Baby, I'm not that kind of man
I might not say I'm sorry
Yeah, I might talk tough sometimes
And I might forget the little things
Or keep you hangin' on the line
[Pre-Chorus]
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget (Can't forget)
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
Into the fire, we cry
[Chorus]
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
I'd do anything
I'd lie for you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
If it came right down to me and you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you
