Everyday Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I used to be the kind of guy
Who'd never let you look inside
I'd smile when I was cryin'
I had nothin' but a life to loose
Thought I had a lot to prove
In my life, there's no denyin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Goodbye to all my yesterdays
Goodbye, so long, I'm on my way
[Chorus]
I had enough of cryin'
Bleedin', sweatin', dyin'
Hear me when I say
Gonna live my life everyday
I'm gonna touch the sky
And I spread these wings and fly
I ain't here to play
Gonna live my life everyday
[Verse 2]
Strange, everybody's feelin' strange
Never gonna be the same
Makes you wonder how the world keeps turning
Life, learnin' how to live my life
Learnin' how to pick my fights
Take my shots while I'm still burnin'
