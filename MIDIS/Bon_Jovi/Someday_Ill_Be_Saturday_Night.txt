[Intro]
Hey, man, I'm alive
I'm taking each day and night at a time
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
[Verse 1]
Hey my name is Jim, where did I go wrong?
My life's a bargain basement and all the good shit's gone
Just can't hold a job, where do I belong?
Been sleeping in my car, my dreams moved on
[Verse 2]
My name is Billie Jean, my love is bought and sold
I'm only sixteen, I feel a hundred years old
My foster daddy went, took my innocence away
The street life ain't much better, but at least I'm getting paid
[Pre-Chorus]
And Tuesday just might go my way
Can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
But somehow I'll survive
[Chorus]
Hey, man, I'm alive
I'm taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man, gotta live my life
Like I ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
