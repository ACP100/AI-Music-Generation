The Boys Are Back in Town Lyrics
[Intro]
The boys are back
The boys are back in town
Hey
[Verse 1]
Guess who just got back today?
Those wild-eyed boys that'd been away
Haven't changed, hadn't much to say
But man, I still think those cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you were, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' the old men crazy
[Chorus]
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
(I said) The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Remember that chick that used to dance a lot?
Every night, she'd be on the dance floor, shakin' what she got
When I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
Oh, I mean she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped poor Johnny's face
Man, we fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her
