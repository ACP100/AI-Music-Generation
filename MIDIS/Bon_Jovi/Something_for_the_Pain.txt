Something for the Pain Lyrics
[Intro]
Take a [?]
Why?
'Cause you can't sleep
[Verse 1]
Happiness, it's been a friend to me
But forever after ain't what it's all cracked up to be
Yeah, I had a taste, you were my fantasy
But I almost lost my faith when I hit reality
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need no guru to tell me what to do
When you're feelin' like a headline on yesterday's news
Come on, come on, come on
[Chorus]
Gimme somethin' for the pain
Gimme somethin' for the blues
Gimme something for the pain when I feel I'm danglin' on a hangman's noose
Gimme shelter from the rain
Gimme somethin' I can use
To get me through the night, make me feel all right
Somethin' like you
[Post-Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
