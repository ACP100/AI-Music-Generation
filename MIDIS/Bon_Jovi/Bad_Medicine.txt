Bad Medicine Lyrics
[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)
[Verse 1]
I ain't got a fever, got a permanent disease
And it'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money, but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms, count 'em, one, two, three
[Pre-Chorus]
First, you need (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little, and it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug
[Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
