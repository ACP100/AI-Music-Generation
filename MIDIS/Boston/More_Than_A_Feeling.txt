More Than a Feeling Lyrics
This is the first track off of Bostonâ€™s self-titled debut album, which describes the emotions that the singer is going through when he hears a particular song that takes him back to his memories of Marianne.
[Verse 1: Brad Delp]
I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away
[Chorus: All]
It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
[Post-Chorus: Brad Delp]
I see my Marianne walkin' away
[Verse 2: Brad Delp]
So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky
[Chorus: All]
It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
[Post-Chorus: All]
I see my Marianne walkin' away
[Guitar Solo: Tom Scholz]
[Verse 3: Brad Delp]
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away
[Chorus: All]
It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
[Instrumental Outro]
