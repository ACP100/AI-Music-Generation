Don't look back (ooh, a new day is breakin')

The sun is shinin' (ooh, the clouds are breakin')
'Cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play
I can tell there's no more time left to criticize
I've seen what I could not recognize
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong, oh, yes, I can
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Ooh, far away and left behind, left behind
