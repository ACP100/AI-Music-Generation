Amanda Lyrics
“Amanda” topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 2 weeks in November 1986 and also topped the charts in Canada for a week in December of that same year, making it Boston’s biggest hit in both the U.S. and Canada.
[Verse 1]
Babe, tomorrow's so far away
There's something I just have to say
I don't think I can hide what I'm feelin' inside
Another day, knowin' I love you
And I, I'm getting too close again
I don't want to see it end
If I tell you tonight would you turn out the light
And walk away knowing I love you?
[Chorus]
I'm going to take you by surprise and make you realize
Amanda
I'm going to tell you right away, I can't wait another day
Amanda
I'm going to say it like a man and make you understand
Amanda
I love you
[Verse 2]
And I feel like today's the day
I'm lookin' for the words to say
Do you wanna be free, are you ready for me
To feel this way
I don't wanna lose you
So, it may be too soon, I know
The feeling takes so long to grow
If I tell you today will you turn me away
And let me go?
I don't want to lose you
