What Can I Say Lyrics
(What can I say?)
(What can I do?)
3 AM, it's me again, wouldn't you know?
Things would have to end this way
I did my best the perfect guest knew when to go
Perfect you knew when to stay
Come on, tell me that you love me, dear
I've been feeling down some too
After all, it's time I made it clear
I've been waiting just for you
(What can I say?) Oh, you make me know, baby
(What can I do?) To show you that I care
(What can I say?) Got to have your number, baby
(What can I do?)
Dodododo....
Can't you see the people just stop and stare
Don't it make you wonder why?
I just happened to be standing there
Can't you see it in my eye?
(What can I say?) You got me acting like a fool, girl
(What can I do?) Stop making like a little schoolgirl
(What can I say?) Could be your lucky day, baby
(What can I do?)
