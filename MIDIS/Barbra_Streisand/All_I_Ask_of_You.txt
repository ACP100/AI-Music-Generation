All I Ask of You Lyrics
[Intro]
Mmmmm hmm hmm hmm hmmmm
Mm mm hmmmmm
[Verse 1]
No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here
Nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here
With you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you
[Chorus 1]
Then say you love me every winter morning
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you
[Verse 2]
Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe
No one will find you
Your fears are far behind you
All we need is freedom
A world that's warm and bright
And you, always beside me
To hold me and to hide me
