Stoney End Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was born from love
And my poor mother worked the mines
I was raised on the good book Jesus
'Til I read between the lines
Now I don't believe I wanna see the morning
[Chorus]
Going down the stoney end
(Going down the stoney end)
I never wanted to go down the stoney end
(Going down the stoney end)
Mama, let me start all over (Mama, let me start all over)
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again
(Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again)
[Verse 2]
And I can still remember him
With love light in his eyes
But the light flickered out and parted
As the sun began to rise
Now I don't believe I wanna see the morning
[Chorus]
Going down the stoney end
(Going down the stoney end)
I never wanted to go down the stoney end
(Going down the stoney end)
Mama, let me start all over (Mama, let me start all over)
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again
(Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again)
(Mama, cradle me again)
