What Kind of Fool Lyrics
[Verse 1: Barbra Streisand & Barry Gibb]
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
Who's sorry now?
[Verse 2: Barbra Streisand, 
Barbra Streisand & Barry Gibb
]
There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated
And then you found her
You let the stranger in
Who's sorry now?
Who's sorry now?
[Chorus: Barbra Streisand & 
Barry Gibb
]
What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow?
Oh, losing you now
Wonderin' why
Where will I be tomorrow?
[Post-Chorus: Barry Gibb]
Forevermore that's what we are to be
Without each other, we'll be remembering when
