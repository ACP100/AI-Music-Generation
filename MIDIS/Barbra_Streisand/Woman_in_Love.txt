[Verse 1]
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place
I kissed the morning goodbye
But down inside, you know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong

I stumble and fall but I give you it all
[Chorus]

To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right I defend over and over again
What do I do?

In love there is no measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I live in each other's heart
We may be oceans away
You feel my love, I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall but I give you it all
