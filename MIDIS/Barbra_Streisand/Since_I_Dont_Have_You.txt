Since I Donâ€™t Have You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
[Verse 2]
I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
[Bridge]
I don't have happiness (Happiness)
And I guess I never will ever again (Yes)
When you walked out on me
In walked Ol' Misery
And he's been here since then
[Verse 3]
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
