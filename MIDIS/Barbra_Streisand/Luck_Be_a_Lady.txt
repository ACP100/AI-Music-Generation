Luck Be a Lady Lyrics
[Verse 1]
They call you lady luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very un-lady-like way
Of running out
You're on a date with me
The pickings have been lush
And yet before this evening is over
You might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray
[Verse 2]
Luck be a lady tonight, luck be a lady tonight
Luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck how I'm longing to see
How good a friend you can be
Stick with me, sister
I'm the one that you came in with
Luck be a lady with me
[Verse 3]
A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the joint
And blow on some other guy's dice
