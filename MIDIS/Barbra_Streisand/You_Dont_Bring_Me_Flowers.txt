You Donâ€™t Bring Me Flowers Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come through the door at the end of the day
I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night
Well, it's good for you
And you're feelin' alright
Well, you just roll over and turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore
[Verse 2]
It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
But used to be's don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor 'til we sweep them away
And, baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well, I learned how to love
Even learned how to lie
So you'd think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
'Cause you don't bring me flowers anymore
