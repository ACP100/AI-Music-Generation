Never Alone Lyrics
Black and white dancin' together
Side by side, we'll make things better
You're never alone
Dancin' together
Side by side, through stormy weather
You're never alone
Never alone, never alone
Never alone, never alone
Never alone, never alone
Never alone, never alone
You're never alone!
Black and white dancin' together
Side by side, we'll make things better
You're never alone
Dancin' together
Side by side, through stormy weather
You're never alone
Never alone, never alone
Never alone, never alone (You're never alone!)
Never alone, never alone
Never alone, never alone
