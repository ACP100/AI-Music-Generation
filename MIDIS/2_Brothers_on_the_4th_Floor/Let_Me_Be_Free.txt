Let Me Be Free Lyrics
(Bridge)
Is it me that you want is it really me
Take control of my mind, but let me be free
Is it me that you want is it really me
Take control of my heart, but let me be free
(chorus)
But let me be free (2x)
(Sub chorus)
But let me be free, yeah (2x)
Many things in life are for free,but your love is what I really need
Even thoug it's like joy and pain, I say the same with no shame
Don't try to change my way .Love me as I am,that's the plan
Is it me so get to the point and let me be free
(Bridge)
(Chorus)
I need to know right now
Or let me be free but I don't know how
To satisfy and I won't lie
It hurts my heart when I make you cry
Positive I am I want to be your man
But you can't understand
Is it me so get to the point or let me be free
