Dreams Lyrics
(Bridge)
Dreams to survive
Dreams make a wish come true, oooh
Keep your dreams alive
Dream... dream on
Your dream will come alive
(Chorus)
Come on dream on
Come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy
Your dream will come alive
Come on dream on
Come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy
Your dream will come alive
Once again a song comin' strong
Here to remind you got to dream on
Go for what you know don't let it slide
Take a change let's ride
To the future not to the past
Take it easy and not to fast
Many failed in society
To blind to see you need to be free
Free from the strain that causes pain
Pain is the name and life is the game
Dream on try to survive
Keep hope alive reach for the sky
Do the best you can make a wish come true
Listen here's the clue:let it flow before it's all gone
Come on boy you got to dream on
