[Verse 1]
Oh well, I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are, well you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em cause to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em; 
they don't even know my name
[Refrain]
They call me the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around
[Verse 2]
Oh well, there's Flo on my left arm and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl well that I’ll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I tear open my shirt and I show her "Rosie" on my chest
[Refrain]
Cause I'm the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around
[Bridge]
Oh well, I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
I with my two fists of iron but I'm going nowhere
