[Intro: Timbaland]
(Uh)
Dirty South (Uh-huh), can y'all really feel me? (Feel us)
East Coast, feel me (Feel us), West Coast, feel me (Say what?)
Dirty South, uh (Here we go), can y'all really feel me? (Baby girl)
East Coast, feel me (Uh-huh), West Coast, feel me (Can you feel us?)
Dirty South, what, what? (Dirty, dirty), can y'all really feel me? (Feel it)
East Coast feel me (Say what?), West Coast feel me (Uh-huh)
Dirty South, uh, uh (D-D-Dirty, dirty), can y'all really feel me? (I can feel you, baby)
East Coast, feel me? (Uh) West Coast feel me (What?)
[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
Boy, I've been watching you like the hawk in the sky
That flies, but you were my prey (My prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin' heads
I know that one of these days (Days)
We gon' hook it up, prolly talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holdin' back this secret from you I probably shouldn't tell it
[Chorus: Aaliyah]
But if I, If I let you know
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?
