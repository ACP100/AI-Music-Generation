Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny
This feelin' inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy, if I did

Or a man who makes potions in a travellin' show, oh
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
[Verse 3]
I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
