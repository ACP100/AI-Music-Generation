I Donâ€™t Wanna Go on with You Like That Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're braggin' one is not enough
Well, somethin' tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five
[Verse 2]
I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carvin' up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me, let's a-call it quits
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah
[Verse 3]
It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's gettin' outta hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads a-faster in a breeze
