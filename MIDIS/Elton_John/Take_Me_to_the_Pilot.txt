Take Me to the Pilot Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If you feel that it's real, I'm on trial
And I'm here, yeah, in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason
[Pre-Chorus]
Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul
[Chorus]
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, 
I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
[Post-Chorus]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na
[Verse 2]
Well, I know he's not old
And I'm told, and I'm told he's a virgin
Or he may be she
What I'm told and I'm never, never for certain
