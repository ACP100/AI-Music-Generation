The Day (That You Gave Me a Son) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
'Twas late December the news came
And I got so excited, I cried all day, yes
And you were such a lovely, precious sight
When I saw our baby in your eyes
[Chorus]
It was like falling deep in love
I heard the angels cry above
I felt a blessing straight from God
The day that you gave me a son
[Verse 2]
I called 'bout everyone I knew, yes
Just think, I'll be a father 'cause of you
Oh, there's no greater love than what you gave
A brand new baby on the way
[Chorus]
It was like falling deep in love
I heard the angels cry above
I felt a blessing straight from God
The day that you gave me a son
[Bridge]
Oh, such tears of joy, I've never known
I can't remember
It's like a song, I've never heard
I've never sung, but know the words
