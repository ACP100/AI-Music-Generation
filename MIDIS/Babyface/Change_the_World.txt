Originally released as a Clapton single featuring Face in 1996, marking their first co-operation. Babyface performed live together with Clapton at MTV Unplugged 1997
[Intro: Babyface]
Well, let's do it
(
One, two, three
)
[Verse 1: Babyface]
If I can reach the stars
Pull one down for you, baby, yeah
I shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth, baby, yeah
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems. baby, yeah
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams
[Chorus: Babyface]
That I can change the world
Said I will be the sunlight in your universe
And you would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could, yeah, change, yes, the world
Woo
[Verse 2: Eric Clapton]
If I were a king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule
In this kingdom we had made
'Til then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day
