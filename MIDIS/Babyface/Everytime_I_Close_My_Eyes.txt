Everytime I Close My Eyes Lyrics
[Verse 1: Babyface]
Girl, it's been a long, long time comin', yes it has
But I, I know that it's been worth the wait, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Babyface]
Yeah
It feels like springtime in winter
It feels like Christmas in June
It feels like heaven has opened up its gates for me and you, yeah
[Chorus: Babyface, 
Mariah Carey
]
And every time I close my eyes
I thank the Lord that I've got you, yeah (
That I've got you
)
And you've got me too (
You've got me, too
)
And every time I think of it, I pinch myself 'cause
I don't believe it's true, yeah
That someone like you loves me too, yeah
Ay, yeah, yeah baby, yeah
[Verse 2: Babyface]
Ooh ooh girl, I think that you're truly somethin', yes you are, yes
And you're, you're every bit of a dream come true, yes you are, yes
[Pre-Chorus: Babyface, 
Mariah Carey
]
With you, baby (
With you, baby
)
It never rains and it's no wonder
The sun always shines when I'm near you
It's just a blessing that I have found somebody like you, ooh, oh
