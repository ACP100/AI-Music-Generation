Brown Eyed Woman Lyrics
You look at me
And baby all you see
Are my blue eyes
I'm not a man
Baby, all I am
Is what I symbolize
Brown eyed woman
(Stay away, baby)
Brown eyed woman
(Stay away, baby)
Brown eyed woman
(Stay away, baby)
I could love you so
(No, no)
I could love you so
(No, no)
Brown eyed woman
I could love you so
(Mm, mm, mm)
All of the years
All the hate and the fears
Have twisted your heart
Now, you turn away
You won't trust what I say
