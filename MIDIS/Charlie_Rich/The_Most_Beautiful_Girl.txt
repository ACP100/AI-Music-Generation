[Chorus]
Hey, did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?
Hey, if you happen to see

Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby

I let my world slip away from me
[Chorus]
So hey, did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?
Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?
