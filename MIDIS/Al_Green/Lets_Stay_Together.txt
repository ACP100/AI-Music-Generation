[Intro]
Let's stay together
[Verse 1]
I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is all right with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you
[Verse 2]

Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
[Chorus]

Lovin' you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Ooh-ooh, ooh, whoo-ooh-hoo, yeah
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
[Verse 3]
Why somebody, why people break up
Oh, turn around and make up, I just can't see
You'd never do that to me, would you baby?
Just being around you is all I see, it's what I want to do
