Baby, I Love Your Way Lyrics
[Intro]
Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah-eeh-yeah
Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day
[Verse 1]
Shadows grew so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night (Ooh)
Far away from the city
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But don't, oh no, hesitate
'Cause your love just won't wait, hey-eeh-yeah-yeah
[Chorus 1]
Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah-eeh-yeah
I wanna tell you I love your way, every day, yeah-yeah
I wanna be with you night and day
[Verse 2]
The moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
Well, I can see them under the pine
[Pre-Chorus 2]
But don't, woah no no, hesitate, la-di-dah
'Cause your love just won't wait
Hey-eeh-yeah-yeah!
