Knockinâ€™ Lyrics
Are you ready?
Come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let me talk to you, honey
Don't let me see you
Don't let me try to think anything away from you
Just try to hurt me, just try to round me
Think she's got to reach you never
Talk, talk, talk no
Talk, talk, talk no
She just to see, ah
Talk, talk, talk no
Won't you so pretty, so talk!
I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door
Oooh, I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door
Oh, baby, I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door
