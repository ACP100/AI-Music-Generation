Figaro Lyrics
Every morning when sun is dawning
You'll see him down on the beach
Look out, girl, beware better take good care
Keep yourself out of reach
He's out to make a killing, girl
He's out to make a score
And maybe if you're willing, girl
He's gonna ask for more
Oh, oh, Figaro, he's got magic, oho
Oh, oh, Figaro, he's a Romeo, oh
See him down on the beach
He'll be looking for someone new
Searching down on the beach
Figaro, Figaro
When he plays guitar at the disco-bar
He's the star of the show
As the girls go by he just winks an eye
See those pretty girls glow
He's out to make a killing, girl
When dancing on the floor
And maybe if you're willing, girl
He's gonna ask for more
