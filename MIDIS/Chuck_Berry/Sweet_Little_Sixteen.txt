Sweet Little Sixteen Lyrics
[Chorus]
They're really rockin' in Boston
In Pittsburgh, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
And 'round the 'Frisco Bay
All over St. Louis
And down in New Orleans
All the cats wanna dance with
Sweet little sixteen
[Verse 1]
Sweet little sixteen
She's just got to have
About a half a million
Framed autographs
Her wallet filled with pictures
She gets them one by one
Becomes so excited
Watch her, look at her run, boy
[Bridge]
"Oh mommy, M=mommy
Please may I go?
It's such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show
Oh daddy, daddy
I beg of you
Whisper to mommy
It's alright with you"
