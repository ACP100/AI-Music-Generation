Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy
 
named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell
[Chorus]
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Johnny B. Goode

Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passin' by, they would stop and say
"Oh, my, but that little country boy could play"
[Chorus]
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Johnny B. Goode
