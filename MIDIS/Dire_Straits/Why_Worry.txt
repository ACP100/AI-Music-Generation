Why Worry? Lyrics
Why Worry? is the fifth track of Dire Straits‘ fifth studio album “Brothers in Arms”.

The track fits the style of The Everly Brothers, which later on recorded a cover of the song.
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Baby, I see this world has made you sad
Some people can be bad
The things they do, the things they say
But baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears
I'll chase away those restless fears
That turn your blue skies into grey
[Chorus]
Why worry? There should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now?
Why worry now?
[Verse 2]
Baby, when I get down, I turn to you
And you make sense of what I do
I know it isn't hard to say
But baby, just when this world seems mean and cold
Our love comes shining red and gold
And all the rest is by the way
[Chorus]
Why worry? There should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now?
Why worry now?
