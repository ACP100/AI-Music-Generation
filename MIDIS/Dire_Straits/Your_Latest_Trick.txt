Your Latest Trick Lyrics
The fourth track on Brothers in Arms and a turning point for the album. The songs up to this point are poppy and this song ushers in a much more gritty phase of the album.
[Saxophone Solo Intro]
[Verse 1]
All the late night bargains have been struck
Between the satin beaus and their belles
Prehistoric garbage trucks
Have the city to themselves
Echoes and roars of dinosaurs
They're all doing the monster mash
And most of the taxis and most of the whores
Are only taking calls for cash, mmm
[Chorus]
I don't know how it happened
It all took place so quick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick
[Verse 2]
Well now, my door was standing open
Security was laid back and lax
But it was only my heart got-a broken
You must have had a pass key made out of wax
You played robbery with insolence
And I played the blues in twelve bars down on Lovers' Lane
And you never did have the intelligence to use
The twelve keys hanging off of my chain
