Planet of New Orleans Lyrics
[Instrumental intro 0:00-1:32]
[Verse 1]
Standin' on the corner
Of Toulouse and Dauphin
Waitin' on 
Marie Ondine
I'm tryin' to place a tune
Under a 
Louisiana
 moonbeam
On the planet of New Orleans
In a bar they call the Saturn
And in her eyes of green
And somethin' that she said in a dream
Inside of my suit I got my mojo root
And a true love figurine
For the planet of New Orleans
[Chorus]
New Orleans
With other life upon it
And everythin' that's shakin' in between
If you should ever land upon it
You better know what's on it
The planet of New Orleans
[Verse 2]
Now I'm trying to find my way
Through the rain and the steam
I'm lookin' straight ahead through the screen
And then I heard her say
Somethin' in the limousine
'Bout takin' a ride across the planet of New Orleans
