Expresso Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She gets the sun in the daytime
Perfume in the dusk
And she comes out in the night-time
With the honeysuckle musk
Because she smells just like a rose
And she tastes just like a peach
She got me walking where the wildlife goes
I'd do anything to reach her
[Chorus]
And she was made in heaven
Heaven's in the world
Oh, she was made in heaven
Heaven's in the world
Is this just expresso love?
You know I'm crazy for the girl
Just crazy for the girl
[Verse 2]
She call me just to talk
She's my lover, she's a friend of mine
She says, "Hey Mister, you wanna take a walk
In the wild west end sometime?"
And I get trouble with my breathing
When she says boys don't know anything
But I know what I want
Yes, I want everything
