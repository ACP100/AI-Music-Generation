Iâ€™ve Got You Under My Skin Lyrics
Written for the musical, Born To Dance.



Famously covered by Frank Sinatra on his Songs For Swingin' Lovers LP.
[A Section]
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart, you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
[A Section]
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when, darling, I know so well
I've got you under my skin
[B Section]
I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats and repeats in my ear
[A Section]
Don't you know, silly fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin
