Sing Lyrics
“Sing” is the Carpenter’s cover of Joe Raposo’s original 1971 on Sesame Street song. In their version, the Carpenters omit the bilingual aspect of the song, performing in only English.
[Verse 1: Karen Carpenter]
Sing, sing a song
Sing out loud, sing out strong
Sing of good things, not bad
Sing of happy, not sad
[Verse 2: Karen Carpenter]
Sing, sing a song
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Just sing, sing a song
[Chorus: Jimmy Joyce Children’s Choir]
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Sing, sing a song (
Sing, sing
)
Let the world sing along
Sing of love, there could be (
Ooh
)
Sing for you and for me
Sing, sing a song
 (La la la la la, La la la la la la, La la la la la la la)
Make it simple to last your whole life
 
long
 (La la la la la, La la la la la la)
Don't worry that it's not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Just sing, sing a song
Just sing, sing a song (
Ooh
)
Just sing, sing a song
 (Ooh)
