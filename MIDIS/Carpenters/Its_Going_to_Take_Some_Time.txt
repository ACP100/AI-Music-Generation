Itâ€™s Going to Take Some Time Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's gonna take some time this time
To get myself in shape
I really fell out of line this time
I really missed the gate
[Verse 2]
The birds on the telephone line (Next time)
Are crying out to me (Next time)
And I won't be so blind next time
And I'll find some harmony
[Chorus]
But it's going to take some time this time
And I can't make demands
But like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend
[Verse 3]
After all the tears we've spent
How could we make amends? (Ooh)
So it's one more round for experience (Ah)
And I'm on the road again
And it's going to take some time this time
[Bridge]
And I can't make demands
I'll learn how to bend
