Jambalaya (On The Bayou) Lyrics
Cover of the Hank Williams classic.
[Verse 1]
A-goodbye Joe, he gotta go, me oh my oh
He gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou
His Yvonne the sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
[Verse 2]
Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin'
A kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dressed in style they go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
[Chorus]
Jambalaya, crawfish pie and a file gumbo
For tonight, I'm-a gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
[Verse 3]
Settle down far from town, get him a pirogue
And he'll catch all the fish in the bayou
Swap his mon to buy Yvonne what she need-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
[Chorus]
Jambalaya, crawfish pie and file gumbo
For tonight, I'm-a gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
