Hurting Each Other Lyrics
[Verse 1]
No one in the world
Ever had a love as sweet as my love
For nowhere in the world
Could there be a boy as true as you, love
[Pre-Chorus]
All my love I give gladly to you
All your love you give gladly to me
Tell me why then, oh, why should it be that
[Chorus]
We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Hurting each other
Without ever knowing why
[Verse 2]
Closer than the leaves
On a weeping willow, baby, we are
Closer, dear, are we
Than the simple letters A and B are
[Pre-Chorus]
All my life I could love only you
All your life you could love only me
Tell me why then, oh, why should it be that
