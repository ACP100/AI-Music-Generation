Let Me Be the One Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Some sleepless night
If you should find yourself alone
[Chorus]
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one
[Verse 2]
To set things right
When this whole world's turned upside down
[Chorus]
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
(Need someone to turn to)
Let me be the one
[Verse 3]
For love and understanding
To find a quiet place
For silent understanding
A loving touch
