Sweet, Sweet Smile Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're always in my heart
From early in the morning till it's dark
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day
When I wake up in the morning and I see you there
I always whisper a little prayer
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day
[Chorus]
I gotta know that you love me
And that you want me
And that you'll always be there
I gotta know that you care
And I gotta feel your arms around me
And that you need me
And you'll always be there
I gotta know that you care
[Verse 2]
If my times are bringing me down
You're the only one that I want around
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day
And if I'm all strung out
You're the only one who can straighten me out
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day
