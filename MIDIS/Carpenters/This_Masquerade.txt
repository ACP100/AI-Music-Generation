This Masquerade Lyrics
One of three songs written by Leon Russell which the Carpenters covered.
This one appeared on their 1973 album, Now and Then.
[Verse 1]
Are we really happy with this lonely game we play?
Looking for the right words to say
Searching but not finding understanding anyway
We're lost in this masquerade
[Verse 2]
Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
[Chorus]
Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason why we carry on this way
We're lost in this masquerade
[Bridge]
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
[Chorus]
Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason why we carry on this way
We're lost in a masquerade
We're lost in a masquerade
