I Kept On Loving You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I ran away from you and left you crying
And though I'm back to stay, you think I'm lying
But I've changed my ways and my wandering days are through
And through it all, I kept on loving you
[Chorus]
Don't worry, baby, please don't cry
I'm home for good, and I will never leave you
Don't worry, baby, please don't cry
You must believe me and I will never leave you
Never leave you (Never leave you)
[Post-Chorus]
Wah-ah-ah
[Verse 2]
You've heard this song before, I can't deny it
The road was long and wide, I had to try it
Though I loved you, girl, these were things I had to do
But through it all, I kept on loving you
[Chorus]
Don't worry, baby, please don't cry
I'm home for good, and I will never leave you
Don't worry, baby, please don't cry
You must believe me, and I will never leave you
Never leave you (Never leave you)
Don't worry, baby, please don't cry
I'm home for good, and I will never leave you
Don't worry, baby, please don't cry
You must believe me, and I will never leave you (Never leave you)
Never leave you (Never leave you)
