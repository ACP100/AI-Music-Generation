Thereâ€™s a Kind of Hush Lyrics
[Chorus]
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
You can hear the sound of lovers in love
[Verse 1]
You know what I mean, just the two of us
And nobody else in sight
There's nobody else and I'm feeling good
Just holding you tight
[Verse 2]
So listen very carefully
Get closer now and you will see what I mean
It isn't a dream
The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear "I love you"
Forever and ever
[Chorus]
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
People just like us are falling in love
