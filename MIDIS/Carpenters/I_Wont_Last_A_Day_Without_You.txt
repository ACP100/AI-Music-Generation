I Wonâ€™t Last a Day Without You Lyrics
[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 1]
Day after day
I must face a world of strangers
Where I don't belong
I'm not that strong
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to
Who will always care
You're always there
[Chorus]
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But, I won't last a day without you
[Verse 2]
So many times when the city seems to be without
A friendly face, a lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile
[Chorus]
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But, I won't last a day without you
