I Need You Lyrics
[Intro]
I need you, girl
I couldn't live a day without you
[Verse 1]
Well, I tried to write a special song
A love song just for you
To explain the way you make me feel inside
Though the meaning may be simple
And the words may not be new
I couldn't make it clearer if I tried
[Chorus]
I need you
And I couldn't live a day without you
I need you
More than anyone could ever know
I need you
And I wanna build my world around you
I need you
I need you
[Verse 2]
Well, I sang the words and realized
It had all been said before
So I tried a different rhyme that meant the same
But it didn't have the feeling
And the first one said much more
So I guess I'll have to say it once again
