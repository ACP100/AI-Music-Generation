[Chorus]
Why does Monday come before Tuesday
Why do summers start in June
Why do winters come too soon
Why do people fall in love
When they're always breaking up, oh, why
Why do we love if love will die
Why does Wednesday come after Tuesday
Why do flowers come in May
Why does springtime go away
Why do people fall in love
When they're always breaking up, oh, why
Why do I love you, tell me why

I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna think
I don't wanna learn
I don't wanna do anything
It's not like I can describe what's going on
It's just I feel I'm not alive
When you're not home
I don't wanna sleep, I don't wanna be
I just want you here beside me
Without you, there's no me
