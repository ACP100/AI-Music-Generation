Pretty Belinda Lyrics
She lived on a boathouse down by the river
Everyone called her pretty Belinda
Went to the boathouse down by the river
Just for a look at pretty Belinda
All of my loving wanted to give her
As soon as I saw her, pretty Belinda
She lived in a boathouse down on the river
I wanted to have her, pretty Belinda
Her eyes were exciting, her hair it was golden
The lips were inviting and my heart she's stolen!
Now we're together, me and Belinda
Now and forever, me and my Linda
She lives on a boathouse down by the river
Everyone called her pretty Belinda
Went to the boathouse down by the river
Just for a look at pretty Belinda
She lives on a boathouse down by the river
Everyone called her pretty Belinda
Went to the boathouse down by the river
Just for a look at pretty Belinda
Now I am with her, my pretty Belinda
That's what I've sent her, my pretty Belinda
She gave me her heart then, believe me your promise
Will ever bother, Belinda is ominous!
