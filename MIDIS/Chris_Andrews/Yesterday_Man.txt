Yesterday Man Lyrics
[Chorus]
I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
That's what I am, her yesterday man
[Verse 1]
Please tell me something have you met an angel
Someone too lovely to live on earth
Well, yesterdeay I thought I met an angel but
She wasn't worth all she seemed to be worth
[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, what a fool I have been
I was sure taken in
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
That's what I am, her yesterday man
(Gone is the look of love she had last night)
[Verse 2]
There's some of the good kind and some of the bad kind
Some of the others are in between
But all that I can say she is the worst kind
Well, I think you know what I mean
