Boys And Girls Lyrics
[Paroles de "Boys And Girls"]
[Intro]
Oh, baby, swing and shout
Oh, baby, do, blush, hush
Oh, baby, I want-a sweets and pearls
Do what you do t-t-to all those girls
[Verse 1]
Years ago, the boys and girls
Were not like today
Boys thought they could have their way
And the girls'd say "Yeah"
[Pre-Chorus]
Now it's so different, you know what I mean
Girls do need to have fun (Fun, fun, fun, fun)
You'll see the difference when she says to you
"I wanna hold yourâ€”" (Fun, fun, fun, fun)
"I wanna hold on your hand"
[Chorus]
Boys and girls (Dancin' all night)
Boys like girls (The girls who kiss 'n' tell)
Boys and girls (Don't you be so shy)
Boys and girls love games together
