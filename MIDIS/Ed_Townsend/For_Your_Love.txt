For Your Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
For your love
Oh, I would do anything
I would do anything
For your love
[Verse 2]
For your kiss (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Oh, I would go anywhere (ah, ah, ah, ah)
I would go anywhere (ah, ah, ah, ah)
For your kiss
[Bridge]
More foolish I grow
With each heartbeat
But we all get foolish
That's why I repeat
[Verse 3]
For your love (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Oh, I would do anything (ah, ah, ah, ah)
I would do anything
For your kiss
[Saxophone Solo]
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
