Travelinâ€™ Band Lyrics
Drumming is very similar to Good Golly Miss Molly by Little Richard.
[Verse 1]
737 comin' out of the sky
Oh, won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride?
[Chorus]
I wanna move, playin' in a travelin' band, yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land
Tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band
[Verse 2]
Take me to the hotel, baggage gone, oh well
Come on, come on, won't you get me to my room?
[Chorus]
I wanna move, playin' in a travelin' band, yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land
Tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band
[Verse 3]
Listen to the radio, talkin' 'bout the last show
Someone got excited, had to call the state militia
[Chorus]
I wanna move, playin' in a travelin' band, yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land
Tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band, oh, wow!
