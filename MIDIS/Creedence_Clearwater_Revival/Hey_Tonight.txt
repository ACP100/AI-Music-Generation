Hey Tonight Lyrics
[Refrain]
Hey, tonight
Goin' to be tonight
Don't you know I'm flyin'?
Tonight, tonight
[Verse 1]
Hey, come on
Goin' to chase tomorrow
Tonight, tonight
[Chorus]
Goin' to get it to the rafters
Watch me now
Jody's goin' to get religion
All night long
[Verse 2]
Hey, come on
Goin' to hear the song
Tonight, tonight
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Goin' to get it to the rafters
Watch me now
Jody's goin' to get religion
All night long
, aaaah!
