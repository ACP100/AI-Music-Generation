Sweet Hitch-Hiker Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Was riding alongside the highway
Rolling up the countryside
Thinking I'm the devil's heat wave
What you burn in your crazy mind
Saw a slight distraction standing by the road
She was smiling there, yellow in her hair
“Do you want to?” I was thinking, “Would you care?”
[Chorus]
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?
[Verse 2]
Cruising on through the junction
I'm flying about the speed of sound
Noticing peculiar function
I'm no roller coaster, shut me down
I turned away to see her
Whoa! She caught my eye
But I was rolling down, moving too fast
“Do you want to?” she was thinking, “Can it last?”
[Chorus]
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King (yeah)
Sweet hitch-a-hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?
