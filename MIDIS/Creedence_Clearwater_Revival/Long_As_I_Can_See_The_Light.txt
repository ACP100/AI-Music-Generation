Long as I Can See the Light Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Put a candle in the window
But I feel I've got to move
Though I'm going, going
, 
I'll be coming home soon
Long as I can see the light
[Verse 2]
Pack my bag and let's get movin'
'Cause I'm bound to drift a while
While I'm gone, gone, you don't have to worry, no
Long as I see the light
[Saxophone Solo]
[Verse 3]
Guess I've got that old travelin' bone
'Cause that feelin' won't leave me alone
But I won't, won't be losin' my way, no, no
Long as I can see the light
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
[Verse 1]
Put a candle in the window
But I feel I've got to move
Though I'm going, going, I'll be coming home soon
Long as I can see the light
