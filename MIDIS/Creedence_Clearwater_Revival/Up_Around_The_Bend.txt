Up Around the Bend Lyrics
Just another John Fogerty classic “city life will drive you loony so I’d rather be out in the boonies” themed song.
[Verse 1]
There's a place up ahead, and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind
[Chorus]
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Ooh!
[Verse 2]
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the 
neons turn to wood
[Chorus]
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Ooh!
[Verse 3]
You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say
