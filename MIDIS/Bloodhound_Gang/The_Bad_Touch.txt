[Intro: 
Art Linkletter
 & Jimmy Pop]
Ha-Ha! Well now, we call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about
(I'd appreciate your input)
[Verse 1: Jimmy Pop]
Sweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House hash browns
Come quicker than FedEx,
 
never reach an apex,
 
just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early, just like Daylight Savings Time
[Chorus: Jimmy Pop]
Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Getting horny now
[Horn Interlude]
