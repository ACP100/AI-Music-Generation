Ainâ€™t Nobody Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holdin' me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go
[Pre-Chorus]
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
[Verse 2]
I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone
[Pre-Chorus]
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh
