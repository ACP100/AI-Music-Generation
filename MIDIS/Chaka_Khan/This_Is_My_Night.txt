This Is My Night Lyrics
[Intro]
(Tonight)
[Verse 1]
I'm putting on my makeup
It's time to wake up
The owners of the night are calling me
I'm ready and I'm willing
To pull out the happy feeling
Something special's in the air for me
[Pre-Chorus]
The night is mine
I'm gonna keep it just right
An angel in my pocket, right?
It feels so right
This mirror's telling no lie
I'm gonna let this magic shine
[Chorus]
This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine
This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine
