Tell Me Something Good Lyrics
[Intro]
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oh, wait a minute
[Verse 1]
You ain't got no kind of feeling inside
I got something that'll sho'nuff set your stuff on fire
You refuse to put anything before your pride
What I got will knock all that pride aside
[Chorus]
Tell me something good
(Tell me, tell me, tell me)
Tell me that you love me, yeah, come on
Tell me something good
(Ooh, tell me, tell me, tell me)
Tell me that you like it, yeah
[Verse 2]
Got no time is what you're known to say
(Got no time, got no time)
I'll make you wish there were 48 hours (to each day)
Your problem is you ain't been loved like you should
What I got to give will do you good, yeah
