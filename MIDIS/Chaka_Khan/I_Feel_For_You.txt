Let me rock you, that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan, let me rock you
Let me rock you, Chaka Khan
Let me rock you, 'cause I feel for you

Let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka

I wanna rock you, Chaka
Baby, 'cause you make me wanna scream
Let me rock you, rock you
[Verse 1: Chaka Khan]

I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied
