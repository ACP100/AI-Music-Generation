Iâ€™ll Never Break Your Heart Lyrics
[Intro: Kevin]
Baby, I know you're hurting
Right now you feel like
You could never love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you
[Verse 1: AJ & 
Brian
]
From the first day
That I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be
Together, forever, oh, oh, oh
Oooh, when I asked you out
You said "no", but I found out
Darling, that you'd been hurt
You thought that you'd never love again
[Pre-Chorus: Brian & 
AJ
]
I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me
[Chorus: All & 
Brian
]
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me 
(give you all of me)
Honey, that's no lie 
(that's no lie)
I'll never break your heart
(I'll never break your heart, baby)
I'll never make you cry
(I never wanna see you cry)
I'd rather die than live without you
(No, no, live without you)
I'll give you all of me, honey, that's no lie
