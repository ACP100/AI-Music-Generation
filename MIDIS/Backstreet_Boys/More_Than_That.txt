More Than That Lyrics
[Verse 1: Brian & 
AJ
]
I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong?
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines
[Chorus: All & 
Nick
]
Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that
[Verse 2: Nick]
Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on?
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby, knowing in the end
[Chorus: All & 
Brian
]
That I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back
(Can't take them back)
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say 
(hey!)
