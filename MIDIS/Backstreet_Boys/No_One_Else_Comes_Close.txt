No One Else Comes Close Lyrics
[Intro: AJ]
Oh, oh-no, mmmh, yeah
[Verse 1: AJ 
with Brian
]
When we turn down the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
And girl, you know that
I would never 
ever let another's touch
Come between
 the two of us
'Cause no one else will ever take your place
[Chorus: AJ 
with Kevin
]
No one else comes 
close to you
No one makes me feel 
the way you do
You're so special, 
girl, to me
And you'll always be 
eternally
Every time I 
hold you near
You always say the words 
I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch, you can do so much
No one else comes close
[Interlude: All & 
AJ
]
Mmmh-mmh-eh, mmh-mmh
(No one else comes close)
Mmmh-mmh, mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmmh-mmh-eh, mmh-mmh 
(Oh-oh)
Mmmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
