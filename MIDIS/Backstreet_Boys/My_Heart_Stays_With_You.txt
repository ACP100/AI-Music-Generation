My Heart Stays With You Lyrics
[Intro: Howie]
You know, sometimes being on the road is rough
Especially loneliness
[Verse 1: Howie]
Girl I miss you and it's only been one day
Since I went away and already I say
I long to kiss you and hold you in my arms
The nights are much too long when you're gone
Baby, that's why
[Chorus: All & (Howie)]
Wherever I go
Girl, my heart stays with you
My heart stays with you
After every show
I want to rush over to you
(Over to you)
My heart stays with you
[Verse 2: Howie]
Trust me, when we are apart
I won't break your heart
Wherever you are, I know you feel me
Baby, cause I can feel you too
No matter what you do
I think of you
