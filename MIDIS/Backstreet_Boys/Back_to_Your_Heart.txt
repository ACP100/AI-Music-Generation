Back To Your Heart Lyrics
[Intro: AJ]
Hmmm-mmh
Oh-oh-oh yeah
[Verse 1: AJ & 
Nick
]
It's not that I can't live without you
It's just that I don't even want to try
Every night I dream about you
Ever since the day we said goodbye
If I wasn't such a fool
Right now I'd be holding you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Baby if I only knew
[Chorus: Brian with All]
The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart?
[Interlude: AJ]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, hmmm
[Verse 2: Brian & 
Nick
]
I don't know how it got so crazy
But I'll do anything to set things right
'Cause your love is so amazing
Baby you're the best thing in my life
Let me prove my love is real
And make you feel the way I feel
I promise I would give the world
If only if you would tell me girl
