10,000 Promises Lyrics
[Verse 1: AJ]
Once we were lovers
Just lovers we were
Oh, what a lie
Once we were dreamers
Just dreamers we were
Oh, you and I
[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
Now I see you're just somebody
Who wastes all my time and money
What a lie, you and I
[Chorus: All]
What about your
Your 10,000 promises
That you gave to me?
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me
[Verse 2: AJ]
Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I, mmmh
But time after time
All the promises turned out to be all lies
And now...
