Itâ€™s Gotta Be You Lyrics
[Intro: Nick & 
All
]
Baby, it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
It's gotta be you
Uh-huh uh-huh, yeah
[Verse 1: AJ]
I can't control it anymore
I've never felt like this before
You really made me lose my head
My hungry heart must be fed
[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Baby, it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
[Chorus: All, (Nick) & 
Brian
]
It's gotta be you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
All the way
It's gotta be you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Everyday
I promise you I will be true, yeah
It's only you
