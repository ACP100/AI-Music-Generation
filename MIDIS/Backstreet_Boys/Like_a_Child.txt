Like a Child Lyrics
[Verse 1: AJ]
If I could right
The wrongs that made you cry
Girl, would you promise not to say goodbye?
Oh-oh, 'cause I'm holding on
With a love so strong
And I can't take the day without you by my side
[Pre-Chorus 1: Brian]
Girl, if I could change
If I could change your mind
Maybe you could help me
Wipe these tears from my eyes
[Chorus: All & 
Brian
]
Girl, don't stop 
(Don't stop)
The sun from shining down on me
(Oh shining down on me, yeah)
'Cause I can't face another day
Without your smile 
(Your smile)
And if you take away the loving arms
That surround me
Then I might break down and cry
Just like a child
[Verse 2: Brian & 
All
]
Girl, I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your loving 
back to me
Oh back to me 
(Oooh)
So I'm pressing on, I hope you understand
That there's a broken heart
That lies within your hands
