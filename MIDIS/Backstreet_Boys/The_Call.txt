I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So, don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"

"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out. I think my battery must be low

[Verse 1: AJ

Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"
