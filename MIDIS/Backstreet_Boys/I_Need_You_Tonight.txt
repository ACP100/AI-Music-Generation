I Need You Tonight Lyrics
[Intro: Nick]
Oh, yeah
[Verse 1: Nick]
Open up your heart to me
And say what's on your mind, oh yes
I know that we have been through so much pain
But I still need you in my life, this time
[Chorus: Nick]
And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you tonight
[Verse 2: Nick]
I figured out what to say to you
Sometimes the words they, they come out so wrong
(Always they do)
And I know in time that you will understand
That what we have is so right, this time
[Chorus: Nick]
And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
