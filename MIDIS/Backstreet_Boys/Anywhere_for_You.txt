Anywhere for You Lyrics
[Intro: All, 
Brian
 & 
Nick
]
(Oooh-yeah)
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you 
(anything)
Anything you want me to
Oooh-ooh-oooh-ooh-ooh
(Oooh-ooh-ooh-oooh)
 
Hey baby
[Verse 1: Brian & 
Nick
]
I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun, the stars, the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way, believe me
Even through the darkest night, you know
[Chorus: All & 
Brian
]
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true 
(I know it's true)
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you 
(for you)
