All I Have To Give Lyrics
[Verse 1: Nick & 
Brian
]
I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car to get to you
I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart
[Chorus: Brian & 
All
]
But my love is all 
I have to give
Without you I don't 
think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
 (Give)
[Verse 2: Howie & 
AJ
]
When you talk (When you talk)
Does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave (Does he leave)
When you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby, please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine
