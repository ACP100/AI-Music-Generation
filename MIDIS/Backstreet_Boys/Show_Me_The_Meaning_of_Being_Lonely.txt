[Intro: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
[Verse 1: Brian &

There's somethin' missin' in my heart
[Verse 2: Kevin &

Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
