[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
Jungle life, I'm far away from nowhere

Monkey business on a sunny afternoon
Jungle life, I'm living in the open
Native beat that carries on
Burning bright, a fire that blows a signal to the sky
I sit and wonder, does the message get to you?
[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
Night to night
Give me the other, give me the other
Chance tonight
Give me the other, give me the other
Night to night
Give me the other, give me the other world
