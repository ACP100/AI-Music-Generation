[Chorus]
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler, roll on (Roll on)
[Verse 1]
Well, it's Monday morning, he's kissing momma goodbye
He's up and gone with the sun
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler
And he's off on a midwest run

Ah, but he calls them everynight
And he tells them that he loves them
He taught them this song to sing
[Chorus]
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler, roll on(Roll on)
