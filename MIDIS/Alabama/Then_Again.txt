Then Again Lyrics
We could walk away now, call it over and done
Say we fought the good fight and nobody won
Say we're both better off that worst came to worst
So we didn't last, hey, we're not the first
But then again, if we give it one more try
We might find the feeling can never really die
And there's still a chance to be all we might have been
And find the love we had back then again
Off to such a good start but somehow it seems
We've let our hearts fall apart at the dreams
We could throw in the towel walk away with our pride
Say it just wasn't worth all the tears that we've cried
But then again, if we give it one more try
We might find the feeling can never really die
And there's still a chance to be all we might have been
Let's find the love we had back then again
Maybe if we want it bad enough
We can make it better than it ever was
And there's still a chance to be all we might have been
Let's find the love we had back then again...
