How Do You Fall In Love Lyrics
[Pre-Chorus]
How do you fall in love
And when do you say "I do"
And when is the perfect time
To spend the rest of your life
[Chorus]
Seasons may come and go
And sometimes it rains and snows
And there will be highs and lows
So only you will know
[Verse 1]
You never know just where it will find you
'Cause it can come on you so fast
Or seems like it takes forever
When you want it so bad
[Verse 2]
But don't ever take it for granted
'Cause it's more than sowing some seeds
And it takes sun and water
So give it what it needs
[Pre-Chorus]
And that's how you fall in love
And that's when do you say "I do"
And that's when you know it's time
To spend the rest of your life
