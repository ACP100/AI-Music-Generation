The Closer You Get Lyrics
[Chorus]
The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall
[Verse 1]
The things that you say to me
The look on your face
Brings out the man in me
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love
[Chorus]
The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall
[Verse 2]
Could I be dreaming
Is this really real
Because there's something magic
The way that I feel in your arms tonight
[Chorus]
The closer you get, oh yeah, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, mmhmm, the further I fall
