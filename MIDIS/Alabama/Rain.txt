Rain Lyrics
Come on Lord, give us rain
Come on Lord, make it rain
Come on Lord, send down some rain
Rain, rain, rain for our souls
Well, my path, it's been so dusty
I can't find my way back home
And in my heart, it's been so heavy
Sometimes it's hard to just hold on
So come on Lord, and give us rain
Come on Lord, make it rain
Come on Lord, send down some rain
Rain, rain, rain for our souls
Waters wave down in the river
We've been dry for so long
And I'm mouse on getting fit now
And we're prayin' with that song
So come on Lord, give us rain
Come on Lord, make it rain
So come on Lord, send down some rain
Rain, rain, rain for our souls
Rain, rain, rain for our souls
Rain, rain, rain for our souls
