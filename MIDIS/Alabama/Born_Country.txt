Born Country Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Clear creeks and cool mountain mornin's
Honest work out in the field
Cornbread in my mama's kitchen
Daddy sayin' grace before the meal
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Family ties run deep in this land
And I'm never very far from what I am
[Chorus]
I was born country, and that's what I'll always be
Like the rivers and the woodlands, wild and free
I got a hundred years of down home runnin' through my blood
I was born country, and this country's what I love
[Verse 2]
Moonlight and you here beside me
Crickets serenadin' in the yard
What more could two people ask for?
Layin' here in love beneath the stars
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now this is where I wanna raise my kids
Just the way my mom and daddy did
