I’m In A Hurry (And Don’t Know Why) Lyrics
[Chorus]
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
[Verse 1]
Don't know why
I have to drive so fast
, my car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2, oh
[Chorus]
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
[Verse 2]
Can't be late
I leave in plenty of time, shaking hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock, oh
[Chorus]
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
