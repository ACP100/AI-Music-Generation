High Cotton Lyrics
[Intro]
Yeah, rockin' chair (One, two)
[Verse 1]
We didn't know the times were lean
'Round our house, the grass was green
It didn't seem like things were all that bad
I bet we walked a thousand miles
Choppin' cotton and pushin' plows
And learnin' how to give it all we had
[Verse 2]
As life went on and years went by
I saw the light in daddy's eyes
And felt the love in mama's hands
They kept us warm and kept us fed
And taught us how to look ahead
Now lookin' back, I understand
[Chorus]
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
