Red River Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember camping all night down by the river's edge
Skinny dipping in the bright moonlight, diving off the ledge
Skipping rocks across the water, fishing on an old trot line
Gigging frogs 'til the early morning, smoking dried cross vine
[Chorus]
Take me back down where the Red River rolls
Send me back to Lou'sianne
Take me back down where the white water flows
To the Cajun promised land
Give me my line and my old pirogue
Get me back as fast as you can
Take me back home where the Red River rolls
Take me back down where the Red River rolls
[Verse 2]
Floating down the river on a patched up inner tube
Eating dinner on the ground, made of fresh caught catfish stew
Lay awake at night when I hear a wildcat scream
Telling tales around the campfire light about the girls in our dreams
[Chorus]
Send me back down where the Red River rolls
Send me back to Lou'sianne
Take me back down where the white water flows
To the Cajun promised land
Give me my line and my old pirogue
Get me back as fast as you can
Take me back home where the Red River rolls
Take me back down where the Red River rolls
