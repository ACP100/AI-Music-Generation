When We Make Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There's a light
In your eyes tonight
You know I'd know that look anywhere
You got plans
And I'm one lucky man
Before we get so carried away
There's just something I've been wanting to say
[Chorus]
When we make love
It's more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh, it's such a precious time
We share our hearts, our souls and our minds
When we make love
[Verse 2]
Watching you
Make your little moves
I can tell it's gonna be a long night
All day long
We keep holdin' on
It couldn't be any better than this
I got it all at my finger tips
