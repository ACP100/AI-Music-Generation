[Intro]
Yo, listen up, here's a story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue, like him, inside and outside
Blue his house with a blue little window and a blue Corvette
And everything is blue for him and himself and everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen (To listen, to listen, to listen)
[Chorus: Zorotl]
I'm blue, da-ba-dee, da-ba-di
Da-ba-dee, da-ba-di, da-ba-dee, da-ba-di
Da-ba-dee, da-ba-di, da-ba-dee, da-ba-di
Da-ba-dee, da-ba-di, da-ba-dee, da-ba-di
I'm blue, da-ba-dee, da-ba-di
Da-ba-dee, da-ba-di, da-ba-dee, da-ba-di
Da-ba-dee, da-ba-di, da-ba-dee, da-ba-di
Da-ba-dee, da-ba-di, da-ba-dee, da-ba-di
[Verse: Zorotl]
I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the color of all that I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue
Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my Corvette, it's in and outside
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me
