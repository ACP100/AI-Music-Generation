Another Race Lyrics
[Chorus]
It's another race from outer space
It's another race away, away
It's another race from outer space
It's another race away, away
[Refrain]
It's another race
It's another race
[Verse]
They seem to walk on air
And they act pretty strange
They live around us
But you can't recognize them
We can't communicate
With their one way brain
No matter how you try
You just won't understand them
[Chorus]
It's another race from outer space
It's another race away, away
It's another race from outer space
It's another race away, away
