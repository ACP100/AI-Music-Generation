Your Clown Lyrics
[Intro]
(I don't wanna be your clown again
No, I don't wanna live this triangle
I don't wanna be your clown now
'Cause I long to carry on)
(I don't wanna be your-
I don't wanna be your-
I don't wanna be your-)
[Verse]
In the beginning, you were oh so clear
It started out as somethin' pure and sincere
But now I see the evil within
So tell me, what's the reason?
In the beginning, it was so clean
Nobody else, just love was all it could mean
But now you tell me that there's somebody else
But you don't want to leave me
[Chorus]
But I don't wanna be your clown again
No, I don't wanna live this triangle
I don't wanna be your clown now
'Cause I long to carry on
No, I don't wanna be your clown again
No, I don't wanna live this triangle
I don't wanna live your life, girl
'Cause I long to carry on
