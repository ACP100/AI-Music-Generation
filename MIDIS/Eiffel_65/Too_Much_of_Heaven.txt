Too Much of Heaven Lyrics
[Intro]
Too much of Heaven
Can bring you underground
Heaven, can always turn around
Too much of Heaven
A life and soul hell-bound
Heaven, the kill that makes no sound
Too much of Heaven
Can bring you underground
Heaven (Yeah), can always turn around
Too much of Heaven (Heaven)
A life and soul hell-bound
Heaven (Yeah), the kill that makes no sound
[Bridge]
You still talk about money
That's right
And too much of Heaven
Come on, my friend
[Pre-Chorus]
Let me tell you what it's all about
It's called money dependence today
As people just keep on goin' on
Lookin' at the dollar bill
And nothin' else around them
No love
And no friendship
Nothing else
Just the dollar bill goin' on into their pocket
Into their bank account
And that's too much of Heaven bringing them underground
Let me tell you what it's all about
It's called money dependence today
As people just keep on goin' on
Lookin' at the dollar bill
And nothin' else around them
No love
And no friendship
Nothin' else
Just the dollar bill going on into their pocket
Into their bank account
(Ach, ach, ach, ach, ach, ach)
