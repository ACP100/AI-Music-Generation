Lucky (In My Life) Lyrics
I've been lucky in my life
I've been lucky, I've been lucky in my life
I know I've been lucky in my life
And I've been lucky and I thank you for this light
Oh good Lord
Oh good Lord
Oh good Lord
Got my family
And I've got all my friends
I've been lucky in my life
And I got no money but
There's no need to give up
I've been lucky in my life
I've been lucky in my life
I've been lucky, I've been lucky in my life
I know I've been lucky in my life
And I've been lucky and I thank you for this light
Oh good Lord
Oh good Lord
Got my family
And I've got all my friends
I've been lucky in my life
And I got no money but
There's no need to give up
I've been lucky in my life
