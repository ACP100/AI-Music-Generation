Back In Time Lyrics
Back in time (time, time, time)
One more time
Always up and down
All the time I'm flying (high)
Back in time
In my time, all the time
Up and down
Every time I'm flying
Back in time
In my time, one more time
Always up and down
All the time I'm flying (high) [x3]
Here in the open space where nothing
Seems to move at all
I can run this race back in time
From the world I can hide
Here in the open space where something
Seems to float and not fall
I can feel the madness slow down
I'm the master of time
Back in time
In my time, all the time
Up and down
Every time I'm flying
Back in time
In my time, one more time
Always up and down
All the time I'm flying (high) [x2]
