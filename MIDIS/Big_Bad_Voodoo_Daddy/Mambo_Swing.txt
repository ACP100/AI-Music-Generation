Mambo Swing Lyrics
Swingin' through the jungle
I have sailed the Seven Seas
King of the monkeys
And nothin' bothers me
I wanna fly right to the sky
I wanna touch the moon
But I hear them callin' me
I'll have to come back soon
And I said: "Whoa ho ho"
The band: Whoa ho ho - ho ho ho
It's you and me and the mambo swing
"Whoa ho ho"
The band: Whoa ho ho - ho ho ho
It's you and me and the mambo swing
(YEAH!)
Fires in the city
There was dancin' in the streets
More than a scene
And mambo was the king
I wanna fly right back through time
Like a fever without care
And I hear it calling me
And I wanna take you there
