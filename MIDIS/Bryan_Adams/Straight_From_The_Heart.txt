[Verse 1]
I could start dreamin' but it never ends
As long as you're gone, we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart
[Verse 2]
You say it's easy, but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Comin' straight from the heart
[Chorus]
Oh, give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go, as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart
[Verse 3]
I see you on the street some other time
And all my words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin'
Straight from the heart
[Chorus]
Oh, give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go, as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart
