One Night Love Affair Lyrics
The song is about a one-night stand. The lyrics describe the encounter and the subsequent parting of ways of the protagonists, who, the song suggests, are concealing deeper feelings.
[Verse]
You're the silent type
And you caught my eye
But I never thought that I'd be touchin' you
How was I to know
I'd let my feelin's go
And that I'd be yours before the night was through?
Yeah
[Chorus]
One night love affair
Tryin' to make like we don't care
We were both reachin' out for somethin', oh
One night love affair
Pretendin' it ain't there
Oh, and now we're left with nothin'
[Verse]
When the mornin' breaks
We go our separate ways
If the night was made for love, it ain't for keeps
But I lose control
As I watch you go
All my senses say I'm in this much too deep
Now you're outta reach
