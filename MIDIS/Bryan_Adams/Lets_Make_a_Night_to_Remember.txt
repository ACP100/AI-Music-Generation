[Verse 1]
I love the way you look tonight
With your hair hanging down on your shoulders
And I love the way you dance your slow sweet tango
The way you wanna do everything but talk
And how you stare at me with those undress me eyes
Your breath on my body makes me warm inside
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's make out, let's do something amazing
Let's do something that's all the way
'Cause I've never touched somebody like the way I touch your body
Now I never wanna let your body go
[Chorus]
Let's make a night to remember
From January to December
Let's make love to excite us
A memory to ignite us
Let's make honey, baby, soft and tender
Let's make sugar, darlin', sweet surrender
Let's make a night to remember all life long
[Verse 2]
I love the way you move tonight
Beads of sweat dripping down your skin
Me lyin' here and you lyin' there
Our shadows on the wall and our hands everywhere
