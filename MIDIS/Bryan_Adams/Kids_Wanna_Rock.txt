Kids Wanna Rock Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Turned on the radio
Sounded like a disco
Must've turned the dial for a couple of miles
But I couldn't find no rock 'n roll
[Chorus]
This computerized crap ain't gettin' me off
Everywhere I go, the kids wanna rock
[Verse 2]
London to LA
Talkin' 'bout the new wave
For a couple of bucks you get a weird haircut
And waste your life away
[Chorus]
Around the world or around the block
Everywhere I go, the kids wanna rock
[Bridge]
Get me my DJ
I got somethin' he's gotta play
Wanna hear it, I can't wait
So turn it up, turn it up, yeah, oh
