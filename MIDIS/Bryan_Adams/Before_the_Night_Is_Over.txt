Before the Night Is Over Lyrics
Hey baby - I got someone and you got someone too
Hey baby - I don't know what we're gonna do
How can something wrong feel so right
C'mon baby - hold on tight
Chorus:
Before the night is over
We're gonna get what we desire
Remember what I told ya
This could set our hearts on fire
Hey baby - we're old enough to know it's a sin
Hey baby - the door is open slide on in
This feels too good to be true
I'll tell ya what I wanna do
Chorus x4
Gonna get what we desire
This could set our hearts on fire
Before the night
Before the night
Before the night is over
I don't wanna tell a lie
This is something we can't hide
Before the night is over
