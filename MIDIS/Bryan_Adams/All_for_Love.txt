All For Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When it's love you give
I'll be a man of good faith
Then in love you'll live
I'll make a stand, I won't break
I'll be the rock you can build on
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold
[Verse 2]
When there's love inside
I swear I'll always be strong
Then there's a reason why
I'll prove to you we belong
I'll be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and pain
[Chorus]
Let's make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold, be the one you want
The one you need
Cause when it's all for one, it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love
