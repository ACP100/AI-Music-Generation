Somebody Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I've been lookin' for someone
Between the fire and the flame
We're all lookin' for somethin'
To ease the pain
[Verse 2]
Now who can you turn to
When it's all black and white
And the winners are losers
You see it every night
Oh, yeah!
[Chorus]
I need somebody
(Somebody like you)
Everybody needs somebody
I need somebody
(Hey, what about you)
Everybody needs somebody, oh
[Verse 3]
When you're out on the front line
And you're watchin' them fall
It doesn't take long to realize
It ain't worth fightin' for
