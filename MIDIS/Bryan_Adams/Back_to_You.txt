Back to You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I've been down, I've been beat
I've been so tired that I could not speak
I've been so lost that I could not see
I wanted things that were outta reach
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then I found you and you helped me through
And you showed me what to do
And that's why I'm comin' back to you
[Chorus]
Like a star that guides a ship across the ocean
That's how your love can take me home, back to you
And if I wish upon that star, that someday I'll be where you are
Yeah, I know that day is coming soon
Yeah, I'm comin' back to you
[Verse 2]
You've been alone, but you did not show it
You've been in pain, but I did not know it
You let me do what I needed to
You were there when I needed you
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Might've let you down, might've messed you around
But you never changed your point of view
And that's why I'm coming back to you
