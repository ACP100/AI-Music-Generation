Run to You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She says her love for me could never die
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but her love is cold
Wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cause
When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch
[Chorus]
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run to you
'Cause when the feeling's right, I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you
[Verse 2]
She's got a heart of gold, she'd never let me down
But you're the one that always turns me on, you keep me comin' 'round
[Pre-Chorus]
I know her love is true
But it's so damn easy makin' love to you
I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch
