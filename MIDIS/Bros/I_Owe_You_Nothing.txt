I Owe You Nothing Lyrics
I, I
I, I
Oooh!
I'll watch you crumble
Like a very old wall, oooh
And I'll see you stranded, yeah
You took me for a fool, oooh
I'll have my revenge, oooh, oooh, yeah
'Cause I owe you nothing, nothing at all
I owe you nothing, oooh, oh
Nothing at all
I owe you nothing
Nothing, nothing at all
Nothing, nothing at all, all, mmm, oh
I'll watch you suffer
With no feelings, no feelings at all, oooh
And I'll see you desperate, yeah
You won't hear my call
And he who laughs last, oooh, oooh, yeah
Owes you sweet nothing, nothing at all
