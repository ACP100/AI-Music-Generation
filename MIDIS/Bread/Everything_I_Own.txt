Everything I Own Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, set me free
[Pre-Chorus]
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you
[Chorus]
And I would give anything I own
Would give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
[Verse 2]
You taught me how to love
What it's of, what it's of
You never said too much
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you
[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go
