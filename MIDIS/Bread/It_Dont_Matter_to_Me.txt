It Donâ€™t Matter to Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It don't matter to me
If you really feel that you need some time to be free
Time to go out searching for yourself
Hoping to find time to go to find
[Verse 2]
It don't matter to me
If you take up with someone who's better than me
'Cause your happiness is all I want
For you to find peace, your peace of mind
[Bridge]
Lotta people have an ego hang-up
'Cause they wanna be the only one
How many came before, it really doesn't matter
Just as long as you're the last
Everybody moving on and trying to find out
What's been missing in the past
[Verse 3]
And it don't matter to me
If your searching brings you back together with me
'Cause there'll always be an empty room waiting for you
An open heart waiting for you
Time is on my side
