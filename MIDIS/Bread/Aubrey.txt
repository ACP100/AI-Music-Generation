Aubrey Lyrics
[Verse 1]
And Aubrey was her name
A not so very ordinary girl, or name
But who's to blame
For a love that wouldn't bloom?
For the hearts that never played in tune?
[Bridge 1]
Like a lovely melody that everyone can sing
Take away the words that rhyme, it doesn't mean a thing
[Verse 2]
And Aubrey was her name
We tripped the light and danced together, to the moon
But where was June?
No, it never came around
If it did, it never made a sound
[Bridge 2]
Maybe I was absent or was listening too fast?
Catching all the words but then the meaning going past
[Chorus 1]
But God, I miss the girl
And I'd go a thousand times around the world, just to be
Closer to her than to me
