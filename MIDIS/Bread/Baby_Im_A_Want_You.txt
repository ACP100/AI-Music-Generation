Baby Iâ€™m-a Want You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm-a want you, baby, I'm-a need you
You're the only one I care enough to hurt about
Maybe I'm-a crazy, but I just can't live without
[Verse 2]
Your loving and affection, giving me direction
Like a guiding light to help me through my darkest hour
Lately I'm-a praying, that you'll always be a-staying
Beside me
[Chorus]
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Lately I'm-a praying, that you'll always be a-staying
Beside me
[Chorus]
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Then you came along and made me laugh and made me cry
You taught me why
