Kiss the Rain Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hello
Can you hear me?
Am I getting through to you?
Hello
Is it late there?
There's a laughter on the line
Are you sure you're there alone?
'Cause I'm
Trying to explain
Something's wrong
You just don't sound the same
Why don't you, why don't you
Go outside, go outside?
[Chorus]
Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
If your lips feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn
Keep in mind
We're under the same sky
And the night's
As empty for me as for you
If you feel
You can't wait till morning
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
