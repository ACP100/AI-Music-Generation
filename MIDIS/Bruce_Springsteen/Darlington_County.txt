Darlington County Lyrics
[Intro]
Woo!
Yeah-ooh!
[Verse 1]
Driving into Darlington County
Me and Wayne on the Fourth of July
Driving into Darlington County
Looking for some work on the county line
We drove down from New York City
Where the girls are pretty, but they just want to know your name
Driving into Darlington City
Got a union connection with an uncle of Wayne's
[Pre-Chorus 1]
We drove 800 miles without seeing a cop
We got rock and roll music blasting off the T-top
[Chorus]
Singin' sha-la-la, sha la-la, la-la
Sha-la-la, la, la-la, la
Sha-la-la, sha la-la, la-la
Sha-la-la, la, la-la, la
[Verse 2]
Hey, little girl standing on the corner (Hey!)
Today's your lucky day for sure, all right
Me and my buddy, we're from New York City
We got $200; we want to rock all night (Oh, yeah)
Well, girl, you're looking at two big spenders
Why, the world don't know what me and Wayne might do
Our pa's each own one of the World Trade Centers
For a kiss and a smile, I'll give mine all to you
