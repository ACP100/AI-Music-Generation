Human Touch Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You and me, we were the pretenders
We let it all slip away
In the end, what you don't surrender
Well, the world just strips away
[Verse 2]
Girl, ain't no kindness in the face of strangers
Ain't gonna find no miracles here
Well, you can wait on your blessings now, darlin'
I got a deal for you right here
[Chorus 1]
I ain't lookin' for prayers or pity
I ain't comin' round searchin' for a crutch
I just want someone to talk to
And a little of that human touch
Just a little of that human touch
[Verse 3]
Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town
Ain't no bread from heavenly skies
Ain't nobody drawin' wine from this blood
It's just you and me tonight
[Chorus 2]
Tell me, in a world without pity
Do you think what I'm asking's too much?
I just want something to hold on to
And a little of that human touch
Just a little of that human touch
