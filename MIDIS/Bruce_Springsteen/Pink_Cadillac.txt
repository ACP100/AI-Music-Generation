Pink Cadillac Lyrics
Cut from his Born in the USA album, the song got limited airplay until Natalie Cole covered it in 1988.

The song is an extended metaphor for sex, and what “Pink Cadillac” means in that context.
[Verse 1]
Well now, you may think I'm foolish
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do
Well baby, you know you bug me
There ain't no secret 'bout that
Well, come on over here and hug me
Baby, I'll spill the facts
Well honey, it ain't your money
'Cause baby I got plenty of that
[Chorus]
I love you for your pink Cadillac, 
crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in the back
Of your pink Cadillac, pink Cadillac
[Verse 2]
Well now, way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well, they tempt you, man, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasure
That the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
But man, I ain't going for that
