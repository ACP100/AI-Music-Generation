Donâ€™t Cry Daddy Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Today, I stumbled from my bed with thunder crashing in my head, my pillow still wet from last night tears
And as I think of giving up, a voice inside my coffee cup kept crying out, ringing in my ears
[Chorus]
"Don't cry, daddy, daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy, ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry"
[Verse 2]
Why are children always first to feel the pain and hurt the worst? It's true, but somehow it just don't seem right
'Cause every time I cry, I know it hurts my little children so, I wonder, "Will it be the same tonight?"
[Chorus]
"Don't cry daddy, daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy, ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
Oh, daddy, please don't cry"
