Too Much Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Well, honey, I love you too much
I need your lovin' too much
Want the thrill of your touch
Well, gee, I can't love you too much
You do all the livin' while I do all the givin'
'Cause I love you too much
[Verse 2]
Well, you spend all my money too much
I have to share you, honey, too much
When I want some lovin', you're gone
Don't you know you're treatin' your daddy wrong?
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken-hearted
'Cause I love you too much
[Verse 3]
I need your lovin' all the time
Need your huggin', please be mine
Need you near me, stay real close
Please, please hear me, you're the most
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken-hearted
'Cause I love you too much
