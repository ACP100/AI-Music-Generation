Love Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel, but love me
Wring my faithful heart
Tear it all apart, but love me (Won't you love me?)
[Verse 2]
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh-so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only
[Chorus]
I would beg and steal (Beg and steal)
Just to feel (Just to feel)
Your heart (I want your heart)
Beating close to mine (So close to mine)
[Verse 3]
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh-so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only (Ooh)
[Chorus]
I would beg and steal (He would beg and steal)
Just to feel (Yes, just to feel)
Your heart (I want your heart)
Beating close to mine (So close to mine)
