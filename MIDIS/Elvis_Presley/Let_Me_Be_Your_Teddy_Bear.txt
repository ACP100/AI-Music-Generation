(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear Lyrics
Because of this song, fans would send Elvis teddy bears as gifts.  Every year, on his birthday, just inundated with teddy bears at his door.
[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, let me be your loving teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be (Oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
[Chorus]
I don't wanna to be your tiger
'Cause tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be your lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough
[Verse 2]
I just wanna be your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be (Oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
[Verse 3]
Baby, let me be around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair
And cuddle me real tight
Oh, let me be (Oh, let him be)
Your teddy bear
