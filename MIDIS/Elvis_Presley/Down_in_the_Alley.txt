Down In The Alley Lyrics
[Intro]
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane Jane
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane Jane
[Verse 1]
Down in the alley, just you and me
We're going bowling till half past three
Just rocking and reeling, we'll get that feeling
Down in the alley, oh baby Gee
[Verse 2]
I plant you now and dig you later
'Cause you're a fine sweet potato
We'll have a ball and that ain't all
Down in the alley, just you and me
[Verse 3]
The clock is striking a mournful sound
This time of evening my love comes down
That's when I'm missing your kind of kissing
Down in the alley, that's where I'll be
Alright, oh
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
Down in the alley, we sure have fun
We just get started 'bout half past one
So if you're 'round just come on down
Down in the alley and you will see
