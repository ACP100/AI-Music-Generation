Always On My Mind Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
[Pre-Chorus]
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
[Verse 2]
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
[Pre-Chorus]
If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm so sorry I was blind
[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
