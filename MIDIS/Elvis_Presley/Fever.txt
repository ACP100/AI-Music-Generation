Fever Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Never knew how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
[Chorus]
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
[Verse 2]
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right
[Chorus]
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
