Crying In the Chapel Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I'm happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day
[Chorus]
I've searched (I've searched) and I've searched (I've searched)
But I couldn't find
No way on earth to gain
Peace of mind
[Verse 2]
Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord (One accord)
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord
[Chorus]
You'll search (You'll search) and you'll search (You'll search)
But you'll never find
No way on earth to gain
Peace of mind
