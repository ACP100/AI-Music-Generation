Hound Dog Lyrics
This song was written by the team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, and first recorded by Big Mama Thornton in 1952. Leiber claims that writing the tune took “like twelve minutes.” Thornton’s version, below:
[Chorus]
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
[Verse]
When they said you was high-classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, they said you was high-classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
[Chorus]
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
[Bridge]
[Guitar solo]
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
