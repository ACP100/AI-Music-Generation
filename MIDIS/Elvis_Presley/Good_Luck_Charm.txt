Good Luck Charm Lyrics
[Intro]
Uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh
Oh, yeah
[Verse 1]
Don't want a four-leaf clover
Don't want an old horse shoe
Want your kiss 'cause I just can't miss
With a good luck charm like you
[Chorus]
Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh-huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight
[Verse 2]
Don't want a silver dollar
Rabbit's foot on a string
The happiness in your warm caress
No rabbit's foot can bring
[Chorus]
Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh-huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight
