I Want You, I Need You, I Love You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hold me close, hold me tight
Make me thrill with delight
Let me know where I stand from the start
I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart
[Verse 2]
Every time that you're near
All my cares disappear
Darling, you're all that I'm living for
I want you, I need you, I love you
More and more
[Chorus]
I thought I could live without romance
Uh-uh, until you came to me
But now I know that I will go on
Loving you eternally
[Verse 3]
Won't you please be my own?
Never leave me alone
'Cause I die every time we're apart
I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart
