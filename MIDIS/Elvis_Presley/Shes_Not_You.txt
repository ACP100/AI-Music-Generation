Sheâ€™s Not You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Her hair is soft
And her eyes are oh-so blue
She's all the things a girl should be
But she's not you
She knows just how to make me laugh
When I feel blue
She's everything a man could want
But she's not you
[Bridge]
And when we're dancing
It almost feels the same
I've gotta stop myself from
Whispering your name
[Verse 2]
She even kisses me like
You used to do
And it's just breaking my heart
'Cause she's not you
[Chorus]
And it's just breaking my heart
'Cause she's not you
