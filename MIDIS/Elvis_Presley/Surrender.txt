Surrender Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When we kiss, my heart's on fire
Burning with a strange desire
And I know each time I kiss you
That your heart's on fire too
[Verse 2]
So, my darling, please surrender (Surrender)
All your love so warm and tender (Surrender)
Let me hold you in my arms, dear
While the moon shines bright above
[Verse 3]
All the stars will tell the story
Of our love and all its glory
Let us take this night of magic
And make it a night of love
[Outro]
Won't you please surrender to me (Surrender)
Your lips, your arms, your heart, dear? (Surrender)
Be mine forever
Be mine tonight
