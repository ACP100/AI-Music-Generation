Frankie and Johnny Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Frankie and me, we were lovers
Oh lordy, how we did love
Swore we'd be true to each other
Just as true as stars above
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong
[Verse 2]
My luck in poker was fading
When a new gal caught my eye
I gambled
, I tried to change my luck
With a chick named Nellie Bly
I was Frankie's man but I was doing her wrong
[Verse 3]
Yeah, Frankie came looking to find me
Yes, she wasn't looking for fun
For in her sweet loving hand
She was toting' a .44 gun
To shoot her man if he was doing her wrong
[Verse 4]
Well, Frankie looked into the barroom
And right there in front of her eye
There was her loving Johnny
Making love to that Nellie Bly
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong
