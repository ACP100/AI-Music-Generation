Fools Fall In Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Fools fall in in love in a hurry
Fools give their hearts much too soon
Just put in two bars of "Stardust"
Just hang out one silly moon
[Verse 2]
Oh, they've got their love torches burning
When they should be playing it cool
I used to laugh but now I'm the same
Take a look at a brand new fool
[Verse 3]
Fools fall in love just like schoolgirls
Blinded by rose colored dreams
They build their castles on wishes
With only rainbows for beams
[Verse 4]
Oh, they're making plans for the future
When they should be right back in school
I used to laugh but now I'm the same
Take a look at a brand new fool, all right
[Instrumental Break]
