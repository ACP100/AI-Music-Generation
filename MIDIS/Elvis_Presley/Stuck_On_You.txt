Stuck on You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake-a sugar, but you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh
No-sir-ee, uh-uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
[Verse 2]
I'm gonna run my fingers through your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Uh-uh-huh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
[Verse 3]
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch you, and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart
[Verse 4]
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-huh
Huh, huh
Oh yeah, huh, huh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
