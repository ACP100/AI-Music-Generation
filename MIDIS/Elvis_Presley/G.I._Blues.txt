G.I. Blues Lyrics
[Verse 1]
They give us a room with a view of the beautiful Rhine
They give us a room with a view of the beautiful Rhine
But give me a muddy old creek in Texas any old time
[Chorus]
I've got those hup, two, three, four
, 
Occupation G.I. Blues
From my G.I. hair
 to the heels of my G.I. shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon, I'm gonna blow my fuse
[Verse 2]
We get hasenpfeffer
 
and black pumpernickel for chow
We get hasenpfeffer and black pumpernickel for chow
I'd blow my next month's pay for a slice of Texas cow
We'd like to be heroes, but all that we do here is march
We'd like to be heroes, but all that we do here is march
And they don't give the Purple Heart for a fallen arch
[Chorus]
I've got the hup, two, three, four
, 
Occupation G.I. Blues
From my G.I. hair
 to the heels of my G.I. shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon, I'm gonna blow my fuse, yeah
[Verse 3]
The frauleins are pretty as flowers, but we can't make a pass, ooo
The frauleins are pretty as flowers, but we can't make a pass
'Cause they're all wearing signs saying: "Keepen sie off the grass"
