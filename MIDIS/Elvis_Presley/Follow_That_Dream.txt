Follow That Dream Lyrics
[Verse 1]
(Follow that dream, I've got to follow)
(Keep a-moving, move along, keep a moving)
I've gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I gotta follow that dream to find the love I need
[Verse 2]
When your heart gets restless, time to move along
When your heart gets weary, time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you
There's just one thing that you can do
[Chorus]
Well, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need
[Post-Chorus]
Keep a-moving, move along, keep a moving
[Verse 3]
Gotta find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me
And when I find her, I may find out
Just what my dreams are all about
[Chorus]
I've gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I gotta follow that dream to find the love I need
I've gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I gotta follow that dream to find the love I need
