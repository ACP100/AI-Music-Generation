[Chorus]
It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me, my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow
Will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait
[Verse 1]
When I first saw you
With your smile so tender
My heart was captured
My soul surrendered
I spent a lifetime
Waiting for the right time
Now that you're near
The time is here at last
[Chorus]
It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me, my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow
Will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait
