Puppet On a String Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Every time you look at me
I'm as helpless as can be
I become a puppet on a string
You can do most anything with me
All you do is touch my hand
And your wish is my command
I become a puppet on a string
And you can do most anything with me
[Bridge]
If you really love me
Darling, please be kind
I offer you the truest love
That you will ever find
[Verse 2]
Take my heart and please be fair
Handle it with loving care
For I'm just a puppet on a string
And you can do most anything with me
[Bridge]
If you really love me
Darling, please be kind
I offer you the truest love
That you will ever find
