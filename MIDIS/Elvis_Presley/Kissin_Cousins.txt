Kissinâ€™ Cousins Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Well, I've got a gal, she's as cute as she can be
She's a distant cousin, but she's not too distant with me
We kiss all night
I squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins, that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right
[Verse 2]
Oh, I've got a gal, and she taught me how to live
She can give a lot, and she's got a lot to give
We kiss all night
I squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins, and that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right
[Bridge]
Yeah, we're all cousins, that's what I believe
Because we're children of Adam and Eve
[Verse 3]
I got a gal, and she wants a lot of love
That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of
We'll kiss all night
I'll squeeze her tight
But we'll be kissin' cousins, and that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
We'll be kissin' cousins, and that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
