Hard Headed Woman Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Well, a hard-headed woman
A soft-hearted man
Been the cause of trouble
Ever since the world began
[Chorus]
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man, uh-huh
[Verse 2]
Now Adam told to Eve
"Listen here to me
Don't you let me catch you
Messing round that apple tree"
[Chorus]
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
