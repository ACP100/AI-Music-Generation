Blue Suede Shoes Lyrics
[Intro]
Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go
[Chorus]
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes
[Verse 1]
Well, you can knock me down, step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
Well, do anything that you wanna do
But, uh-uh, honey, lay off of them shoes
[Chorus]
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes
Let's go, cat!
[Guitar Solo]
Ah, walk the dog
[Verse 2]
You can burn my house, 
steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Well, do anything that you want to do
But, uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes
