[Intro]
Goodbye, I lied
Don't cry, would you let it ride?
Goodbye, I lied
Don't cry, would you let it ride?
[Verse 1]
You can see the mornin', but I can see the light
Try, try, try, let it ride
While you've been out runnin', I've been waitin' half the night
Try, try, try, let it ride
[Chorus]
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?
[Verse 2]
Seems my life is not complete, I never see you smile
Try, try, try, let it ride
Baby you want the forgivin' kind, and that's just not my style
Try, try, try, let it ride
[Chorus]
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?
