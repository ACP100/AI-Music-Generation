Hey You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hey you!
You say you wanna change the world
It's alright
With me! There's no regret
It's my turn!
The circle game has brought me here
And I won't let down 'till every song is set
[Pre-Chorus]
You realize now!
You should have tried now, oh!
The music's gone now!
You lost it, somehow
[Chorus]
Hey you!
Sha la la la
Hey you!
Sha la la la
Woo!
Sha la la la
Woo!
Sha la la la
[Verse 2]
Hey you!
You say the race is much too fast
It's okay
With me! I'm keeping pace
It's my game!
The music is inside my head
For every one on top there's one who can't retrace
