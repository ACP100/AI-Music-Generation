Soldier Soldier Lyrics
[Intro]
Soldier, soldier, don't look down
I'm here for you in every town
Soldier, soldier, don't look down
I'm here for you in every town
[Verse 1]
Mama told Mary not to go downtown
Too many lovely boys hanging around
Mary didn't listen, she went away
There she met a boy who took her away
[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, soldier, soldier, don't look down
I'm here for you in every town
[Chorus]
Soldier, soldier, don't look down (Soldier, soldier, don't look down)
There's no sixpack on the ground (There's no sixpack on the ground)
Soldier, soldier, don't look up (Soldier, soldier, don't look up)
There's no whore gonna pick you up (There's no whore gonna pick you up)
[Verse 2]
Mama is worried and she gets real loud
'Cause soldiers are a dirty crowd
Don't be mad, I love him so
It's my life and I have to go
