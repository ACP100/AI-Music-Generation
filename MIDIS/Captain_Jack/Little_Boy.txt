Little Boy Lyrics
(Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Go out and have some joy)
(Little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Dream on my, little boy
Go out and have some joy)
(Duu, dubibadadadaduu
Dabadideidada
Duu, dubibadadadaduu
Dabadideidada)
Dream on, dream on, make my day
You will find a better way
Dream on and you'll realize
That one day you'll pay the price
Keep on going till tomorrow
You will find there is no sorrow
Keep on dreaming of this toy
You can use my little boy
(Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Dream on, my little boy
Go out and have some joy)
