Drill Instructor Lyrics
Hi!
This is Captain Jack!
(Do you really follow me into the light?
Drill instructor's on, drill instructor's on my side
Do you really make commands of dynamite?
Love and peace is our fight)
(All for one
Come together, friends, we have to take this chance
All for one
Come together, friends, we gotta take this chance tonight)
Forward march!
Drill instructor, tell me what to do (Drill instructor tell me what to do)
I'm your man, I will follow only you (I'm your man, I will follow only you)
See us making love all through the night (See us making love all through the night)
That's the reason why drill instructor loves to fight (That's the reason why drill instructor loves to fight)
Now sound off (One, two)
Bring it on up (Three, four)
Bring it on down (One, two, three, four)
(One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four)
(Do you really follow me into the light?
Drill instructor's on, drill instructor's on my side
Do you really make commands of dynamite?
Love and peace is our fight)
