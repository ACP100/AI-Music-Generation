Deadweight Lyrics
[Intro]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
[Verse 1]
On a highway, unpaved, going my way
You're so alone today
Like a ghost town, I've found
There's no belief, no salt in the sea
Is it true what they say? You can't behave
You gambled your soul away
Measuring your dreams
Oh, this life seems like the gristle of loneliness
[Chorus]
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
[Verse 2]
Like an ice age, nice days on your way
Sipping the golden drinks
On a rip-tide, freak's ride
Sleep inside, a parasite's appetite
Oh, say can't you see? The chemistry
The parasites, the clean up fee
Death never hands recycled cans
And get well cards to the hostage vans
