[Verse 1]
In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe

So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it
[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
Who's chokin' on the splinters
