Turn It Up (Remix) / Fire It Up Lyrics
[Produced by Busta Rhymes & Spliff Star (co.)]
[Intro]
Oh, ah, ah
Ohhhh, ah-ah-ah
Check it out
Flipmode Squad, raw deluxe shit
'98, check it out, yo
[Verse 1]
I be the street shit, the nigga your mama freak with
Put y'all niggas on it, y'all know how to keep a secret
When I get money, you know I like to keep it
How I get money, niggas are tryin' to peep it
Flipmode be niggas you wanna form a team with
Them get-money niggas, the ones to plot the scheme with
Them niggas that be used to gettin' money frequent
The ones that would always measure my triple beam with
Until they start takin' my niggas to the precinct
That's all back in the day, yo, that ain't nothin' recent
'Cause nowadays it be bitches we like to speak with
Eat with, lay 'em down and sleep with
Type of pussy make a nigga wanna keep it
Shorty be so exotic, she lookin' decent
Lot of corny niggas be offerin' wack free shit
I can't hold the heat no more, yo, I gotta release it
