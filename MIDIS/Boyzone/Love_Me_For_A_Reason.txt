Love Me for a Reason Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Girl, when you hold me
How you control me
You bend and you fold me
Any way you please
It must be easy for you
The lovely things that you do
But just a pastime for you
I could never be
[Pre-Chorus]
And I never know, girl
If I should stay or go home (Go away, girl)
'Cause the games ('Cause the games)
That you play (That you play)
Keep driving me away (Driving me away)
[Chorus]
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
