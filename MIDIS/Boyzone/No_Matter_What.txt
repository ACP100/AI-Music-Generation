No Matter What Lyrics
[Verse 1: Stephen]
No matter what they tell us
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach us
What we believe is true
[Verse 2: Ronan]
No matter what they call us
However, they attack
No matter where they take us
We'll find our own way back
[Chorus: All, 
Stephen
]
I can't deny what I believe
I can't be what I'm not (I know I'll love)
I know I'll love forever
 (I know)
I know, no matter what
[Verse 3: Ronan, 
All
]
If only tears were laughter
If only night was day
If only prayers were answered 
(Hear my prayer)
Then we would hear God say
[Verse 4: Stephen]
No matter what they tell you
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach you
What you believe is true
