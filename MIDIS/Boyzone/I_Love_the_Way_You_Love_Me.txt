I Love the Way You Love Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I like the feel of your name on my lips
And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
The way that your fingers run through my hair
And how your scent lingers even when you're not there
[Verse 2]
And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two-hour bath
And how you've convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane
[Chorus]
But I love the way you love me, oh, baby
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul so completely
I love the way you love me
[Verse 3]
And I like the sound of old R&B
And you roll your eyes when I'm sloppily off-key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
From sappy old movies you've seen thousands of times
[Chorus]
And I love the way you love me, oh, baby
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul so completely
I love the way you love me
