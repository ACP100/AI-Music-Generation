Words Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
'Cause that would bring a tear to me
[Pre-Chorus]
This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story
Now my love
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say
[Chorus]
It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away
[Verse 2]
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
[Pre-Chorus]
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say
