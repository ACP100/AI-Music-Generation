A Different Beat Lyrics
Let's not forget this place
Let's not neglect our race
Let unity become
Life on earth be one
So let me take your hand
We are but grains of sand
Born through the winds of time
Given a special sign
So let's take a stand
And look around us now people
Let's take a stand
And look around us now people
Eeyea-oh, eeyea-oh, eeyea-oh, by-yah
To a different beat
Eeyea-oh, eeyea-oh, eeyea-oh, by-yah
Humanity's lost face
Let's understand it's grace
Each day one at a time
Each life, including mine
Let's take a stand
And look around us now, people
So let's take a stand
And look around us now
People oh people, oh people
