Oh, Boy! Lyrics
[Intro]
All of my love
All of my kissin'
You don't know what youâ€™ve been a-missin'
[Chorus]
Oh boy (
Oh boy
)
When you're with me
Oh boy (
Oh boy
)
The world can see that you were meant for me (
Ahh-ah
)
[Pre-Chorus]
All of my life
I been a-waitin'
Tonight there'll be no hesitatin'
[Chorus]
Oh boy (
Oh boy

When you're with me
Oh boy (
Oh boy
)
The world can see that you were meant for me (
Ahh-ah

[Verse]
Stars appear and a-shadows' a-fallin' (
Ahh-ah
)
You can hear my heart a-callin' (
Ahh-ah
)
A little bit of lovin' makes everything right (
Ahh-ah
)
I'm gonna' see my baby tonight (
Ahh
)
