Maryâ€™s Boy Child / Oh My Lord Lyrics
[Intro]
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing
A king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day
[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song
The music seemed to come from afar
