Sunny Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Sunny
Yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny
You smiled at me and really eased the pain
[Pre-Chorus]
The dark days are gone and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
[Chorus]
Sunny, one so true
I love you
[Verse 2]
Sunny (Yeah)
Thank you for the sunshine bouquet (That sweet bouquet)
Sunny
Thank you for the love you've brought my way
[Pre-Chorus]
You gave to me your all and all
And now I feel ten feet tall
[Chorus]
Sunny, one so true
I love you
