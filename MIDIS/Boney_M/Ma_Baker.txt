[Intro]
Freeze! I'm Ma Baker
Put your hands in the air and give me all your money!
This is the story of Ma Baker
The meanest cat from old Chicago town
[Verse 1]
She was the meanest cat in old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat, she really mowed them down
She had no heart at all — no, no, no heart at all
She was the meanest cat, oh, she was really tough
She left her husband flat, he wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along 'cause they were mean and strong
[Chorus]
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, she taught her four sons
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, to handle their guns
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, she never could cry
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, but she knew how to die
[Verse 2]
They left a trail of crime across the USA
And when one boy was killed she really made them pay
She had no heart at all — no, no, no heart at all
