A Girl Like You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I've never known a girl like you before
Now, just like in a song from 
days of yore
Here you come a-knocking, knocking on my door
And I've never met a girl like you before
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
You gave me just a taste so I want more
Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'Cause now you got me crawling, crawling on the floor
And I've never known a girl like you before
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
You made me acknowledge the devil in me
I hope to God I'm talking metaphorically
Hope that I'm talking allegorically
Know that I'm talking by the way I feel
[Chorus]
And I've never known a girl like you before
Never, never, never, never
Never known a girl like you before
