Obsession Lyrics
[Verse 1: Bill Wadhams]
You are an obsession (You are an obsession)
I cannot sleep (I cannot sleep)
I am a possession (I am your possession)
Unopened at your feet
There's no balance (There is no balance)
No equality (No equality)
Be still (Be still)
I will not accept defeat (I will not accept defeat)
[Pre-Chorus: Astrid Plane]
I will have you, yes, I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly, a wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you
[Chorus: Astrid Plane & Bill Wadhams]
You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me?
You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me?
[Verse 2: Bill Wadhams]
I feed you, I drink you
By day and by night
I need you, I need you
By sun or candlelight
You protest, you want to leave
Stay, oh, there's no alternative (There's no alternative)
