Ride on Time Lyrics
The song samples “Love Sensation” by Loleatta Holloway, an 80’s disco hit.
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up
And time won't take my love away
Wa-ho, wa-ho, wa-wa-ho, wa-wa-wa-wa-ho
You're such a, you're such a, you're such a
You're such a hot temptation, you just walk right in, walk- walk- walk right in and
Wa-ho, wa-ho, wa-wa-ho, wa-wa-wa-wa-ho
Wa-Wa-ho, wa-ho, wa-wa-wa-wa-ho, wa-wa-wa-ho
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up (Thank- thank- thank you, baby)
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up (Just don't move)
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up (Thank- thank- thank you, baby)
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up (Walk right in and)
'Cause you're right on time, 'cause you're right on time, right on time
'Cause you're right on time, 'cause you're right on time, right on time
Let me tell you, let me tell you what you do, what you do, what you do to me
You're such a hot temptation, you just walk right in, walk- walk- walk right in and
Wa-ho, wa-ho, wa-wa-ho, wa-wa-wa-wa-ho
Wa-Wa-ho, wa-ho, wa-wa-wa-wa-ho, wa-wa-wa-ho
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up (Thank- thank- thank you, baby)
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up (Just don't move)
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up (Thank- thank- thank you, baby)
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up (Walk right in and)
Away
