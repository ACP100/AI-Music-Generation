[Intro]
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
[Chorus]
Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

From a feint into a slip and a kicking from the hip
[Chorus]
Everybody was kung fu fighting

Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening, hey, yeah
But they fought with expert timing
[Verse 2]

He said, "Here comes 
the big boss
, let's get it on"
We took a bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip, now we're into a brand new trip
