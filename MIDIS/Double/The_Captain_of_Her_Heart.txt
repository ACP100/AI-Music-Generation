The Captain of Her Heart Lyrics
[Verse]
It was way past midnight
And she still couldn't fall asleep
This night the dream was leavin'
She tried so hard to keep
And with the new day's dawning
She felt it driftin' away
Not only for a cruise
Not only for a day
[Chorus 1]
Too long ago, too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart
[Chorus 2]
As the day came up she made a start
She stopped waiting another day for
The captain of her heart
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Chorus 1]
Too long ago, too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart
