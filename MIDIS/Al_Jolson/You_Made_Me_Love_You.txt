You Made Me Love You Lyrics
You made me love you
I didn't want to do it
I didn't want to do it
You made me want to
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy
Sometimes you made me glad
But there were time baby
You made me feel so bad
You made me cry cause
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't want to tell you
I want some love that's true
Yes I do, deed I do, you know I do
Gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie what I cry for
You know you got the kind of kisses that I die for
You know you made me love you
You made me cry for
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't want to tell you
I want some love
That's true, yes I do, deed I do, you know I do
Gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie what I cry for
You know you got the kind of kisses that I die for
You know you made me love you
