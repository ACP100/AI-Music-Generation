Torn Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Peace is what they tell me
Love, am I unholy?
[Pre-Chorus]
Lies are what they tell me
Despise you that control me
[Chorus]
The peace is dead in my soul
I have blamed the reasons for
My intentions poor
Yes, I'm the one who
The only one who
Would carry on this far
[Verse 2]
Torn, I'm filthy
Born in my own misery
[Pre-Chorus]
Stole all that you gave me
Control, you claim you save me
[Chorus]
The peace is dead in my soul
I have blamed the reasons for
My intentions poor
Yes, I'm the one who
The only one who
Would carry on this far
