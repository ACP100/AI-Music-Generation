Whatâ€™s This Life For Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hurray for a child that makes it through
If there's any way because
The answer lies in you
They're laid to rest before
They've known just what to do
Their souls are lost because
They could never find
[Chorus]
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
[Verse 2]
I see your soul, it's kind of gray
You see my heart, you look away
You see my wrist, I know your pain
I know your purpose on your plane
Don't say a last prayer because
You could never find
[Chorus]
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
