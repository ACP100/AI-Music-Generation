Higher Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When dreaming, I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise, I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake
[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"
[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
[Verse 2]
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is to let love replace all our hate
