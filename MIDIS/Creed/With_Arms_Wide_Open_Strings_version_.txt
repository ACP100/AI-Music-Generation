With Arms Wide Open (Strings Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Well, I just heard the news today
It seems my life is gonna change
I close my eyes, begin to pray
Then tears of joy stream down my face
[Chorus]
With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
[Verse 2]
Well, I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be
I'll take her breath, I'll take her by my side
We stand in awe, we've created life
[Chorus]
With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open, wide open
