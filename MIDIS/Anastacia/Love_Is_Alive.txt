Love Is Alive Lyrics
[Intro]
Love is alive, love is alive, yeah
Love is alive, love is alive, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Whooooo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
[Verse 1]
When I think that it's time to get ready
To realize just what I have found
I have been only half of what I am
It's all clear to me know
[Chorus]
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turning
My love is alive
My love is alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoo! (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
Well, there's something inside that's makin' me crazy
I try to keep me together
'Cause, baby, what I think
May not happen that way
Now I could be forever and ever
