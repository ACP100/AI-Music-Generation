[Verse 1]
All the time that we spend together
I won't fuss, I won't fight
Tryin' to make you mine
You know I'm not that kind, c'mon
I said I'll love you 'til the 12th of never
But I won't run far ahead
Leaving you behind
You know I'm not that kind
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not that kind of girl (
Not that kind of girl
)
And it's not my kind of world (
Not that kind of girl
)
No, it's not for me (
Not that kind
)
Not where I wanna be (
No, not that kind of girl
)
[Verse 2]
Help me out, tell me what you're thinkin'
If I rush, slow me down
You can take your time
You know I'm not that kind
(Not that kind, no, I'm not that kind of girl)
If you leave, I believe life will go on
The wind will blow, water flow
And the sun will shine, yeah, it will
You know I'm not that kind
