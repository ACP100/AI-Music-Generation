[Chorus]
Why'd you lie to me?
Can't be trusted, good-for-nothin' type of brother
Everything you claimed to be was a lie, lie
Why'd you lie to me?
You been creepin', sneakin', sleepin' with another
Messed up, it's time to leave, so, bye-bye
[Verse 1]
Used to treat me like a queen
Said I was your everything
Promised me that you would never cheat on me
But I found a number on the floor
And I won't take it no more
Made me feel so crazy, thinkin' you'd be true to me
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, baby
Did you really think that I would maybe
I'd turn the other cheek and let you play me?
I thought you were different but you're like the rest, it's true
[Chorus]
Why'd you lie to me?
Can't be trusted, good-for-nothin' type of brother
Everything you claimed to be was a lie, lie
Why'd you lie to me?
You been creepin', sneakin', sleepin' with another
Messed up, it's time to leave, so, bye-bye
(Yeah)
