[Verse 1]
When I'm lost in the rain
In your eyes I know I'll find the light
To light my way
When I'm scared

You're always there giving me all you've got
[Chorus]

For a love to keep me safe and warm
I turn to you
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
I turn to you, yes
[Verse 2]
When I lose the will to win
I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again
I can do anything
'Cause your love is so amazing
'Cause your love inspires me
And when I need a friend, you're always on my side
Giving me faith, taking me through the night, yeah
