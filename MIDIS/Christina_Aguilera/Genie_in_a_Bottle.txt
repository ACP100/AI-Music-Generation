[Intro]
(Come on, come on, uh, yeah)
Oh-ooh, whoa-oh (Come on, come on, uh)
[Verse 1]
I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips and blowin' kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(But my heart is sayin', "No, no")
[Chorus]
If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle, baby)
You gotta rub me the right way (Yeah)
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah)
Gotta like what you do
