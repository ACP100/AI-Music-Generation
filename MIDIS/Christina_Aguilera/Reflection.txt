Reflection Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Look at me; you may think you see who I really am, but you'll never know me
Every day, it's as if I play a part
Now I see if I wear a mask, I can fool the world, but I cannot fool my heart
[Chorus]
Who is that girl I see staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
[Verse 2]
I am now in a world where I have to hide my heart and what I believe in
But somehow I will show the world what's inside my heart and be loved for who I am
[Chorus]
Who is that girl I see staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Must I pretend that I'm someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
[Bridge]
There's a heart that must be free to fly
That burns with a need to know the reason why
[Chorus]
Why must we all conceal what we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me I'm forced to hide?
I won't pretend that I'm someone else for all time
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
