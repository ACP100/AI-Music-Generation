[Intro: Eminem & 
Kim
]
Aw, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again, I'll beat the shit out of you!

Okay!

[Verse 1: Eminem & 
Kim
]
Don't make me wake this baby
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, "Aight, you wanna throw me out? That's fine"
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim
Look at your husband now! (

) I said look at him
He ain't so hot now, is he? Little punk
(
Why are you doing this?!
)
 Shut the fuck up! (
You're drunk!
)
(
You're never gonna get away with this
) 
You think I give a fuck?
Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (
No!
) Sit up front
(
We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?
)
We'll be right back, well, I will, you'll be in the trunk
