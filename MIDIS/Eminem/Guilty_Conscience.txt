[Intro: Mark Avery & 
Eddie
]
Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(
Damn, I'm going fucking insane
)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(
I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes
)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(
Shit is mine
)
And suddenly (
I gotta do this
)
His conscience comes into play (
I gotta do this
)
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, 
Eminem
 & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow her damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude
