[Intro: Eminem]
Hem-de-le-le-le-le-le-le, le-le, le-le
Hem-de-le-le-ne-miah-nuf-niah, ne-nish, ne-ne
 
(Translation?)
[Chorus: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick (Slim Shady)
[Verse 1: Eminem & 
Swifty McVay
]
Ha-ha!
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young-ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass, so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
 (*Biting sounds*)
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital, lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything, I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantel
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle (Ugh)
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
(
Bitch, it's too late
)
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains
[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face (Waah, waah, waah!)
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy, I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight
