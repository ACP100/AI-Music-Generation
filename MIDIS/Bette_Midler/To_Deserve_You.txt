To Deserve You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I see so many golden women, when they walk their feet don't touch the ground
How I want, how I want to deserve you
But me? I'm always out of rhythm, my needs too demanding, too proud
How I want, how I want to deserve you
[Chorus]
I didn't want you to see me like this, the light of the dawn can be cruel
How I want, how I want to deserve you
And if I could be granted a wish I'd shine in your eye like a jewel
How I want to deserve you
[Verse 2]
I would die for you, could you ever love me that much?
How I want, how I want to deserve you
Yes, you tell me this and I want to believe that it's true
Ah, how I want, how I want to deserve you
[Chorus]
I didn't want you to see me like this, I'm weak and I fight like a fool
How I want, how I want to deserve you
And if I could be granted a wish I'd shine in your eye like a jewel
How I want to deserve you
[Bridge]
If I could be your angel I'd trade in my arms for some wings
To keep you close to me
And if I could trade my voice for the silence I know that you need
Ah, how I want, how I want to deserve you
