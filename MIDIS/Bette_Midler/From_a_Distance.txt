From a Distance Lyrics
[Verse 1]
From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight
[Chorus 1]
From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man
[Verse 2]
From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed
[Chorus 2]
From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They are the songs of every man
[Refrain]
God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
