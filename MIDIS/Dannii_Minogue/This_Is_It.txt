This Is It Lyrics
[Chorus]
This is it (this is it)
Oh, this time I know it's the real thing
I can't explain what I'm feeling
I'm lost for words, I'm in a daze
Stunned and amazed by your open ways
This is it (this is it)
Oh, this time I know it's the real thing
I can't explain what I'm feeling
I'm lost for words, I'm in a daze
Stunned and amazed by your open ways
[Verse 1]
Whoo, you smiled at me and suddenly
The wheels of love began to turn inside of me
Hey, you said 'Hello', oh, I felt aglow
Right then and there I knew I'd never let you go
'Cause I know, I know
[Chorus]
This is it (This is it)
Oh, this time I know it's the real thing
I can't explain what I'm feeling
I'm lost for words, I'm in a daze
Stunned and amazed by your open ways
