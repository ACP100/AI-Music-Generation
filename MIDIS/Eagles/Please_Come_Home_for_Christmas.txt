Please Come Home for Christmas Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Bells will be ringing this sad, sad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
[Verse 2]
Choirs will be singing, "Silent Night" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Christmas carols by candlelight
 (Ooh, ooh)
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night
[Verse 3]
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas, my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love
[Verse 4]
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Christmas and New Year's will find you home (Ooh, ooh)
There will be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again
[Instrumental]
