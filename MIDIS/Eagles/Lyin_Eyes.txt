[Verse 1]
City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style
[Verse 2]
Late at night, a big, old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice
[Verse 3]
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town
[Chorus]
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
[Verse 4]
On the other side of town, a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night, anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel
