The Sad Café Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Out in the shiny night, the rain was softly falling
Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent 
inside the Sad Café
Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud the things we could not say
We thought we could change this world with words like "love" and "freedom"
We were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Café
[Bridge]
Oh, expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by
[Verse 2]
Some of their dreams came true
Some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind
Inside the Sad Café
[Bridge]
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more
(Ooh) Now I look at the years gone by
(Ooh) And wonder at the powers that be
(Ooh) I don't know why fortune smiles on some
(Ooh) And lets the rest go free
