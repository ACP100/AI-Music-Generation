The Long Run Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out 'til the break of day
Oh, that didn't get it, it was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I did some damage
I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely
'Til I found you
[Chorus]
You can go the distance, we'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
We can handle some resistance if our love
Is a strong one (Is a strong one)
[Pre-Chorus]
People talking about us
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down
We will still come through
[Chorus]
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run
