Wasted Time Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Well, baby, there you stand
With your little head down in your hand
Oh, my God, you can't believe
It's happening again
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone
And it looks like the end
[Verse 2]
And you're back out on the street
And you're trying to remember, oh
How do you start it over?
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man
[Chorus 1]
You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time
[Verse 3]
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell, fell
You didn't love the boy too much
No, no, you just
Loved the boy too well
Farewell
