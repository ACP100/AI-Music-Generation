Love Will Keep Us Alive Lyrics
[Chorus]
I was standing all alone against the world outside
You were searching for a place to hide
Lost and lonely, now you've given me the will to survive
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
[Verse 1]
Don't you worry, sometimes you've just got to let it ride
The world is changing right before your eyes
Now I've found you, there's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
[Bridge]
I would die for you
Climb the highest mountain
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
[Refrain]
Now I've found you
There's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
[Instrumental Solo]
[Bridge]
I would die for you
Climb the highest mountain
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
