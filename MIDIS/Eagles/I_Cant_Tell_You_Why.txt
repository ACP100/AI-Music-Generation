I Canâ€™t Tell You Why Lyrics
Not only the first song finished for the album The Long Run, but also the first Eagles song to feature new bassist Timothy B. Schmit on lead vocals.
[Verse 1]
Look at us, baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark? Ahh-ah
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
[Chorus 1]
And I can't tell you why
[Verse 2]
When we get crazy, it just ain't right
(Try to keep your head, little girl)
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry, just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
'Cause I love you
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
[Chorus 2]
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
