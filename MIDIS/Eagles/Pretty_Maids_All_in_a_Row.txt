Pretty Maids All in a Row Lyrics
The first song sung by Joe Walsh after he joined The Eagles, Pretty Maids All In A Row depicts the meeting of old friends or lovers, and the feelings that come from such an event.
[Verse 1]
Hi there, how are you? It's been a long time
Seems like we've come a long way
My, but we learn so slow
And heroes, they come and they go
And leave us behind as if we're supposed to know
Why
Why
Why do we give up our hearts to the past?
And why must we grow up so fast?
[Verse 2]
And all you wishing well fools with your fortunes
Someone should send you a rose
With love from a friend, it's nice to hear from you again
And the storybook comes to a close
Gone are the ribbons and bows
Things to remember, places to go
Pretty maids all in a row
