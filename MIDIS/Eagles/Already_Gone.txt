Already Gone Lyrics
Peaking at #32 on the Billboard Hot 100 on June 29, 1974, “Already Gone” is one of The Eagles' true classics.
[Verse 1]
Well, I heard some people talkin' just the other day
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
But let me tell you, I got some news for you
And you'll soon find out it's true
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song
[Post-Chorus]
Woo-hoo, hoo, my, my
Woo-hoo, hoo
[Verse 2]
The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right
Just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky
You can see the stars and still not see the light
(That's right)
[Chorus]
And I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song
