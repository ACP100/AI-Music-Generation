[Verse 1]
I turn on the tube and what do I see?
A whole lot of people crying, "Don't blame me"
They point their crooked little fingers at everybody else
Spend all their time feeling sorry for themselves
Victim of this, victim of that
Your mamma's too thin and your daddy's too fat
[Chorus]
Get over it
Get over it
All this whining and crying and pitching a fit
Get over it, get over it
[Verse 2]

But you might feel better if I gave you some cash
The more I think about it, Old Billy was right
Let's kill all the lawyers, kill 'em tonight
You don't want to work, you want to live like a king
But the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing
[Chorus]
Get over it
Get over it
If you don’t wanna play then you might as well quit
Get over it, get over it
