When you're out there on your own
Where your memories can find you
Like a circle goes around
You were lost until you found out
What it all comes down to
One by one the lonely feelings come
Day by day they slowly fade away
Ooh, the look was in her eyes
You never know what might be found there
She was dancing right in time
And the moves she made so fine
Like the music that surrounds her
Should I stay or go? I really want to know
Would I lose or win if I try and love again?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love
Right or wrong, what's done is done
It's only moments that you borrow
But the thoughts will linger on
Of the lady and her song
When the sun comes up tomorrow
Well, it might take years
To see through all these tears
Don't let go
When you find it, you will know
