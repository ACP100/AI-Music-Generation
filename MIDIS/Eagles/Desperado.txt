[Verse 1]
Desperado
, 
why don't you come to your senses?
You've been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one, but I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow
[Chorus]
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get

woah, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh, freedom
, 
well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone
[Chorus]
Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes
Away?
