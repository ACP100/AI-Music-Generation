How Can I Fall? Lyrics
[Verse 1:]
Give me time to care
The moment's here for us to share
Still my heart
Is not always there
What more can I say to you?
Could I lie to you?
I'm just too weak to face the truth
Now I know
I should make a move
What more can I say?
[Chorus:]
How can I fall?
How can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't
Give me reasons at all
[Verse 2:]
When all faith is gone
I fight myself to carry on
Yet, I know of the harm I do
What more can I say to you?
