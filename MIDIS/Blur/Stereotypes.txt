Stereotypes Lyrics
The third single from The Great Escape, which peaked at #7 in the UK charts.
[Verse 1]
The suburbs, they are dreaming, they're a twinkle in her eye
She's been feeling frisky since her husband said goodbye
She wears a low cut T-shirt, runs a little B&B
She's most accommodating when she's in her lingerie
[Pre-Chorus]
Wife-swapping is your future
You know that it would suit ya
[Chorus]
Yes, they're stereotypes, there must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming and then you stop dreaming
From time to time, you know you should be going on another bender
[Verse 2]
The suburbs, they are sleeping, but he's dressing up tonight
She likes a man in uniform, he likes to wear it tight
They're on the lovers' sofa, they're on the patio
And when the fun is over, watch themselves on video
[Pre-Chorus]
The neighbours may be staring
But they are just past caring
[Chorus]
Yes, they're stereotypes, there must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming and then you stop dreaming
From time to time, you know you're going on another bender
Yes, there must be more to life than stereotypes
