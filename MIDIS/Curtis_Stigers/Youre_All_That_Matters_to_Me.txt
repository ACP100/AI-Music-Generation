Youâ€™re All That Matters to Me Lyrics
I make mistakes like any man
But I try to love you best I can
I can't convince you
Though heaven knows I try
I've tried to make you see
To make you believe
You're all that matters to me
The ground that you walk
The air that you breathe
Someday you'll discover
I don't want no other, believe me
You're all that matters, baby
All that matters to me
I know that you've been hurt before
But that won't happen anymore, no no
Just give your heart to me
And I'll guard it with my life
I don't know what I'd do
Baby, without you
You're all that matters to me
The ground that you walk
The air that you breathe
Someday you'll discover
I don't want no other, believe me
You're all that matters, baby
All that matters to me
