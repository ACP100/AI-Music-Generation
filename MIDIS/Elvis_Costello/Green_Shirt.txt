Green Shirt Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There's a smart young woman on a light blue screen
Who comes into my house every night
She takes all the red, yellow, orange and green
And she turns them into black and white
[Chorus]
But you tease, you flirt
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
You can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get it
[Post-Chorus]
Better cut off all identifying labels
Before they put you on the torture table
[Verse 2]
'Cause somewhere in the 
Quisling Clinic
There's a shorthand typist 
taking seconds over minutes
She's listening in to the 
Venus line
She's picking out names, I hope none of them are mine
[Chorus]
But you tease, you flirt
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
You can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get it
