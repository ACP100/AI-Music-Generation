Riot Act Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Forever
It doesn't mean forever anymore
I said forever
But it doesn't look like I'm gonna be around much anymore
When the heat gets sub-tropical
And the talk gets so topical
[Chorus]
Riot act
You can read me the riot act
You can make me a matter of fact or a villain in a million
A slip of the tongue is gonna keep me civilian
[Bridge]
Why do you talk such stupid nonsense
When my mind could rest much easier?
Instead of all this dumb-dumb insolence
I would be happier with amnesia
[Verse 2]
They say forget her
Now it looks like you're either gonna be before me or against me
I got your letter
Now they say I don't care for the color that it paints me
