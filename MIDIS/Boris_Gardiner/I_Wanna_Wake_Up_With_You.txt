I Wanna Wake Up With You Lyrics
I wanna wake up with you-ou
I wanna be there when you open your eye-eyes
I want you to be the first thing that I see
I wanna wake up with you-ou
I wanna lay by your si-ide baby
I wanna feel every beat of your hear-eart
And throughout the night, I wanna hold you ti-ight
I wanna wake up with you-ou
All the love inside me has been slee-eeping
Waiting till the right one came alo-ong
You can share the love that I've been keeping baby
You can put the music to my so-ong
I wanna wake up with you-ou
I wanna reach out and know that you're ther-ere
I want you to be the first thing that I see-ee
I wanna wake up with you-ou
Do-do-do-dooo, Do-doo-oo
Do-do-do-dooo, Do-do-do-doo
And throughout the night, I wanna hold you ti-ight
I wanna wake up with you-ou
All the love inside me has been slee-eeping
Waiting till the right one came alo-ong
You can share the love that I've been kee-eeping
You can put the music to my song
I wamna wake up with you-ou
I wanna reach out and know that you're ther-ere
I want you to be the first thing that I see-ee
I wanna wake up with you-ou
All the love inside me has been slee-eeping
Waiting till the right one came alo-ong
You can share the love that I've been keeping baby
You can put the music to my so-ong
I wamna wake up with you
I wanna reach out and know (fade)
