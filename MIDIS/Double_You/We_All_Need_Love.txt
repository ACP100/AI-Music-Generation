We All Need Love Lyrics
We all need love . . . . 
I swear it's true all that children me and you
I swear it's true all that children me and you
We all need love . . . 
I was just alone and mad with my suitcase in my hand
Part of a travelling band on the road ( well we are knowing .. )
And a motorgirl ladylike till regret it oh
We all need love I swear it's true
All God's children me and you
We all need love I swear it's true
All God's children me and you
By my brother jump your head
Sister stand up stand by your man
A lover know that you understand
You really need him (I really needed you yes I do)
And sun will shine on you if your love still billow of you
I love some pressure get my back
Don't crave feel away now oh
We all need love I swear it's true
All God's children me and you
We all need love I swear it's true
All God's children me and you
