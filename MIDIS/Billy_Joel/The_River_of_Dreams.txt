[Refrain]
In the middle of the, I go walking in the
In the middle of the, I go walking in the
In the middle of the, I go walking in the
In the middle of the, I go walking in the
[Verse 1]
In the middle of the night (Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep (I go walking in my sleep)
From the mountains of faith (Mountains of faith)
To the river so deep (River so deep)
I must be looking for something (Looking for something)
Something sacred I lost (Sacred I lost)
But the river is wide (Oh, it's wide)
And it's too hard to cross (Too hard to cross)
[Bridge A]
Even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find what I've been looking for
[Verse 2]
In the middle of the night (Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep (I go walking in my sleep)
Through the valley of fear (Valley of fear)
To a river so deep (River so deep)
I've been searching for something (Searching for something)
Taken out of my soul (Taken out of my soul)
Something I'd never lose (Never lose)
Something somebody stole (Something somebody stole)
[Bridge B]
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
Hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is I've been looking for
[Verse 3]
In the middle of the night (Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep (I go walking in my sleep)
Through the jungle of doubt (Jungle of doubt)
To the river so deep (River so deep)
I know I'm searching for something (Searching for something)
Something so undefined (So undefined)
And it can only be seen (Only be seen)
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night
[Refrain]
I go walking in the, in the middle of the
I go walking in the, in the middle of the
I go walking in the, in the middle of the
I go walking in the, in the middle of the
I go walking in the, in the middle of the
I go walking in the, in the middle of the
I go walking in the, in the middle of the
I go walking in the, in the middle of the
