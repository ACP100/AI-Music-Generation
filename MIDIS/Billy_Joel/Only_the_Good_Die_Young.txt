[Verse 1]
Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aww, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
Aww, but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done
[Chorus]
Well, only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
[Verse 2]
You mighta heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aww, but that never hurt no one
So come on, Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained glass curtain you're hidin' behind
Never lets in the sun
[Chorus]
Darlin', only the good die young
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young
[Bridge]
You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
Oh woah woah
[Verse 3]
And they say there's a heaven for those who will wait
And some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun
[Chorus]
You know that only the good die young
Oh-oh-ho, baby
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young
