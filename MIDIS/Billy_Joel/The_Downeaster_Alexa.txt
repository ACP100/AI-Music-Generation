I know there's fish out there, but where God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I got people back on land who count on me
[Verse 3]
So if you see my downeaster "Alexa"
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel
