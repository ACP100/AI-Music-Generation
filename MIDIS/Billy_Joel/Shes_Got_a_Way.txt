[Verse 1]
She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasing
I don't know what it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason anyway
[Verse 2]

I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
And she's got a way of talking

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
[Verse 3]
She's got a way of showing
Oh, how I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on going
She's got a light around her
Oh, and everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her everywhere
