[Verse 1: Billy Joel]
Late at night when it's dark and cold
I reach out for someone to hold
When I'm blue, when I'm lonely
She comes through, she's the only one who can
My baby grand is all I need
[Verse 2: Ray Charles]
In my time, I've wandered everywhere
Around this world, she would always be there
Any day, any hour
All it takes is the power in my hands
This baby grand's been good to me
[Chorus: Billy Joel & Ray Charles]
I've had friends, but they slipped away
And I've had fame, but it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes, I spent them fast enough
But as for women, they don't lust with just one man
But my baby grand is gonna stand by me
[Verse 3: Billy Joel & Ray Charles]
They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio
Why, I don't believe that
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone
But only songs like these played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on
