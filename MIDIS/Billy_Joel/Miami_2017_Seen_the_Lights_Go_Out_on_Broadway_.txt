[Verse 1]
I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the Empire State laid low
And life went on beyond the Palisades
They all bought Cadillacs and left there long ago
They held a concert out in Brooklyn
To watch the Island bridges blow
They turned our power down
And drove us underground
But we went right on with the show (Oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 2]
I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the ruins at my feet
You know we almost didn't notice it
We'd seen it all the time on 42nd Street
They burned the churches up in Harlem
Like in that Spanish Civil War
The flames were everywhere
But no one really cared
It always burned up there before
 (Oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 3]
I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I watched 
the mighty skyline
 fall
The boats were 
waiting at the Battery
The union went on strike, they never sailed at all
They sent a carrier out from Norfolk
And picked the Yankees up for free
They said that Queens could stay
They blew the Bronx away
And 
sank Manhattan out at sea
