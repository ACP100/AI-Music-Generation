[Verse 1]
Ooh-ooh yeah ooh
You're having a hard time and lately you don't feel so good
You're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood
[Chorus]
(It's alright) It's alright, sometimes that's what it takes
(You're only human) You're allowed to make your share of mistakes (Only human ooh-ooh)
[Verse 2]
You better believe there will be times in your life
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool
So take it from me you'll learn more from your accidents
Than anything that you could ever learn at school
[Refrain]
Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll get your second wind
[Verse 3]
Ooh-ooh yeah
It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again
[Chorus]
(It's alright) It's alright though you feel your heart break
(You're only human) You're gonna have to deal with heartache
(You're only human)
