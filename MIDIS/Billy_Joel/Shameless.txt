Well I'm shameless when it comes to loving you
I'll do anything you want me to
I'll do anything at all
And I'm standing here for all the world to see

I don't break easy I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied

And I'm changin' swore I'd never compromise
Oh but you convinced me otherwise
I'll do anything you please
You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist what I couldn't turn down
I can walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you
