It’s Still Rock ’n Roll to Me Lyrics
What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy 'til you spend a lot of money
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock 'n roll to me
What's the matter with the car I'm drivin'?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of white wall tires
Are you gonna cruise a miracle mile?
Nowadays, you can't be too sentimental
You best bet's a true baby blue continental
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock 'n roll to me
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town, but you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine, aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
Well, you could really be a 
Beau Brummel
 baby
If you just give it half a chance
