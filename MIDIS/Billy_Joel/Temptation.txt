It's time for me to be on my way I know
I've got business to conduct
And I've got places to go
But I can't help looking at her sleeping instead

Climbing out of this bed
Because she's such a temptation

And it's my fascination
That's making me act this way
And I know what all of my friends say
They're afraid that I'm losing my touch
But she's such a temptation
Oh, I look so tired 'cause I don't get much sleep
I've got too many commitments
That are too hard to keep
And I try to be rational and I try to be wise
But it all gets blown to pieces
When I look in her eyes
Because she's such a temptation
And nothing can save me
And I might find salvation
If I can tear myself away
