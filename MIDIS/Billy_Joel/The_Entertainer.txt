And I know just where I stand

My belly's got a pot
And there's a pimple on my nose

And I've had to pay my price
The things I did not know at first
I learned by doin' twice
Ah, but still they come to haunt me
Still they want their say
So I've learned to dance
With a hand in my pants
Let 'em rub my neck, and I write 'em a check
And they go their merry way
