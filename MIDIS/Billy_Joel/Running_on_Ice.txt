Running on Ice Lyrics
There's a lot of tension in this town
I know it's building up inside of me
I've got all the symptoms and the side effects
Of city life anxiety
I could never understand why the urban attitude
Is so superior
In a world of high-rise ambition
Most people's motives are ulterior, oh
Sometimes I feel as though I'm running on ice
Paying the price too long
Kind of get the feeling that I'm running on ice
Where did my life go wrong?
I'm a cosmopolitan sophisticate
Of culture and intelligence
The culmination of technology
And civilized experience
But I'm carrying the weight of all the useless junk
A modern man accumulates
I'm a statistic in a system
That a civil servant dominates, oh
And all that means is that I'm running on ice
Caught in a vise so strong
I'm slipping and sliding, 'cause I'm running on ice
Where did my life go wrong?
