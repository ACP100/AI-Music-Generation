Cold war kids were hard to kill, under their desks in an air raid drill
Haven't they heard we won the war? What do they keep on fighting for?
[Verse 4]
Viktor was sent to some Red Army town
Served out his time, became a circus clown
The greatest happiness he'd ever found
Was making Russian children glad and children lived in Leningrad
