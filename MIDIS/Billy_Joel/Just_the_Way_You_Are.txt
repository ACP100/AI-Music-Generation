[Verse 1]
Don't go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
And don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
[Chorus]
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I take you just the way you are
[Verse 2]
Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care
[Chorus]
I don't want clever conversation
Never want to work that hard, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are
[Bridge]
Need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Ah, what will it take 'til you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?
