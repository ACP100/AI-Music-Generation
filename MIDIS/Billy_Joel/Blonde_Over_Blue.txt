Blonde Over Blue Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Some days when I'm far away
In a lonely room in a cold seclusion
Some nights when I'm wound so tight
There is no release, there is no solution
In hell there's a big hotel
Where the bar just closed and the windows never open
No phone so you can't call home
And the TV works but the clicker is broken
[Pre-Chorus]
But in the darkness
I see your light turned on
You know my weakness
You know how I respond to
[Chorus]
Blonde over blue
Your hands are cold, your eyes are fire
Blonde over blue
They shine as though you're burning inside
One word from you
Is all I need to be inspired
Blonde over blue
I need your inspiration tonight
