[Intro]
Hoo-ooh
Ohh-ohh
Mmm-mmm
[Verse 1]
Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, "Sonny, move out to the country"

Is that all you get for your money?
[Chorus]

If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out, mmm mm
Ooh-ooh, uh-huh, mmm
