The One and Only Lyrics
[Intro]
I am the one and only
Oh, yeah
[Verse 1]
Call me, call me by my name
Or call me by my number
You put me through it
I'll still be doing it the way I do it
And yet, you try to make me forget
Who I really am, don't tell me I know best
I'm not the same as all the rest
[Chorus]
I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me
[Verse 2]
I've been a player in the crowd scene
A flicker on the big screen
My soul embraces one more in a million faces
High hopes and aspirations
Ideas above my station, maybe
But all this time I've tried
To walk with dignity and pride
