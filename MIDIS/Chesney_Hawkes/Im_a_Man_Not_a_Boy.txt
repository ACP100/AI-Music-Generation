Iâ€™m a Man Not a Boy Lyrics
You say the word and I'll obey
Until I feel like I will overload
You make the rules, you make the rules
But soon I will be on my own
Now I'm going down my road, yeah
You better think about it now I'm free
From this moment I'm listening just to me
Every day when you treat my like a kid
I'm not you're not you're little boy
I'm not your little toy
Every day when you treat my like a kid
I'm not you're not you're little boy
I'm not your little toy
Well I'm a man and not a boy
I'm a man and not a boy
I'm a man not a boy now
I used to listen to your words, oh
I thought you knew the best through thick and thin
But you failed, you have failed
Just look at the mess you're in
Cause I made up my own mind
I started thinkin' for myself
What you taught me, is going back, back on the shelf
