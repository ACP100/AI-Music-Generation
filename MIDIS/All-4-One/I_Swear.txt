I Swear Lyrics
[Intro: All-4-One]
I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side
[Verse 1: Jamie Jones]
I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part
'Cause I stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
[Chorus: All-4-One, 
Jamie Jones
]
And I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
I'll be there
I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there
For better or worse, 'til death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear
[Verse 2: Delious Kennedy, 
Jamie Jones
, 
Delious & Jamie
 
with Tony Borowiak
]
I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls
And when (
And when
) 
just the two of us are there
You won't have to ask if I still care
Cause as the time turns the page, my love won't age at all
