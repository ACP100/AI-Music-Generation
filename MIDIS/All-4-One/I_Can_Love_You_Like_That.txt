[Verse 1]
They read you Cinderella
You hoped it would come true
And one day your Prince Charming
Would come rescue you
You like romantic movies
And you never will forget
The way you felt when Romeo
Kissed Juliet
And all this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more
[Chorus]
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and Earth
If you were my girl
I can give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything
That's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that
I can love you like that
[Verse 2]
I never make a promise
I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever
Forever's what I mean
Well I'm no Casanova
But I swear this much is true
I'll be holding nothing back
When it comes to you
You dream of love that's everlasting
Well baby open up your eyes
