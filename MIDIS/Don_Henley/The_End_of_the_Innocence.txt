Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by

Still untouched by men
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind

And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

Now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie
