New York Minute Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Harry got up, dressed all in black
Went down to the station, and he never came back
They found his clothing scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning
[Verse 2]
He had a home, love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes as years unfurl
One day, he crossed some line, and he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore
[Chorus]
(In a New York minute, woo-ooh, ooh) Everything can change
(In a New York minute, woo-ooh, ooh) Things can get pretty strange
(In a New York minute, woo-ooh, ooh) Everything can change
(In a New York minute, ooh-ooh, ooh)
[Verse 3]
Lying here in the darkness, I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency, somebody's going to jail
You find somebody to love in this world, you better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door
[Chorus]
(In a New York minute, woo-ooh, ooh) Everything can change
(In a New York minute, woo-ooh, ooh) Things can get pretty strange
(In a New York minute, woo-ooh, ooh) Everything can change
(In a New York minute, ooh-ooh, ooh)
