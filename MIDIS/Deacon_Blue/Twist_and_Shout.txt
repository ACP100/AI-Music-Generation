Twist and Shout Lyrics
You've got a lot of
Thhings to say about the
Big world and the
High skies so you
Walk a little in a
Long mile to be
Sure your eyes can see the
Right sights
I see a
Pale girl in a
Blue room with a
Pink dress and a
Wide smile I see a
Pale girl in a
Blue room with a
Pink dress and a
Wide smile
You've got a little
Way to go before you
Find the knowledge that you're
Searching for so you'll
Turn the big world
Upside down
To find the things that you
Never wanted
