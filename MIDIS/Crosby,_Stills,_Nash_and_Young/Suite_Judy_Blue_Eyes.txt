Suite: Judy Blue Eyes Lyrics
[Part 1]
[Verse 1]
It's getting to the point where I'm no fun anymore
I am sorry
Sometimes it hurts so badly, I must cry out loud
"I am lonely"
[Chorus]
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard
[Verse 2]
Remember what we've said and done and felt about each other
Oh babe, have mercy
Don't let the past remind us of what we are not now
I am not dreaming
[Chorus]
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Bridge]
Tearing yourself away from me now--you are free
And I am crying
This does not mean I don't lov–µ you--I do, that's forever
Yes and for always
