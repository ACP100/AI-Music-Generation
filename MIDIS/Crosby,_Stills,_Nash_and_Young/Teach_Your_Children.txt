Must have a code that you can live by
And so, become yourself
Because the past, is just a goodbye

And feed, them on your dreams
The one they picked, the one you'll know by
[Chorus]
Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you you would cry
So just look at them and sigh
And know they love you

Can't know the fears (And can you see?)
That your elders grew by (We must be free)
And so please help (To teach your children)
Them with your youth (What you believe in)
They seek the truth (Make a world)
Before they can die (That we can live in)
Teach, your parents well
Their children's hell, will slowly go by
And feed, them on your dreams
The one they picked, the one you'll know by
