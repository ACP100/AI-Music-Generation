Horses Through a Rainstorm Lyrics
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm
Or led a lion through a busy street bizarre
There are many things I'd like to turn you on to
But somehow I feel you're safer where you are
If you're looking for examples to refer to
Take a look around yourself I'm sure you'll find
There are many things to make your life much brighter
And I bet there's many more inside your mind
There's a man I know
With no expressions
He's got none at all
There's a man I know
With no expressions, no
He's got none at all
You know, I've never seen this man laughing
Come to think of it I've never seen him cry
But you might by loving start him singing
By and by, he'll stop and sigh
You'll feel a breeze, his nose begins to freeze
And then it winks good-bye
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm
Or led a lion through a busy street bizarre
There are many things I'd like to turn you on to
But somehow I feel you're safer where you are
