In Private Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Take your time and tell me
Where you lie
I realise
That we've been found out this time
[Verse 2]
We should stay together
If we can
But what you've planned
Means there's a difference between
[Chorus]
What you're gonna say
In private
You still want my love
We're in this together
And what you're gonna do
In public
Say you were never in love
That you can remember
[Verse 3]
So discreet
I never tried to meet
Your friends or interfere
I took a back seat between
