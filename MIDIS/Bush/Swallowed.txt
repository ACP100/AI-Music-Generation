Swallowed Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Warm sun, feed me up
I'm leery, loaded up
Loathing for a change
And I slip some
, 
boil away
[Chorus 1]
Swallowed, followed
Heavy about everything but my love
Swallowed, sorrowed
I'm with everyone and yet 
not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet
[Verse 2]
Just wanna be myself
Hey, you said you would love to try some
Hey, you said you would love to die some
In the middle of a world on a fish hook
You're the wave, you're the wave, you're the wave
[Chorus 2]
Swallowed, borrowed
Heavy about everything but my love
Swallowed, hollowed
Sharp about everyone but yourself
Swallowed, oh no
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet
