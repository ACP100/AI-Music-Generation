Greedy Fly Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Do you feel the way you hate?
Do you hate the way you feel?
Always closest to the flame
Ever closer to the blade
Yeah
[Verse 2]
I am poison crazy lush
Built these hands to lift me up
We are servants of our formulaic ways
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm screaming daisies
From fourteen miles away
I've got my own time
Got it all today
[Chorus]
Make up your mind
I need some help
To find this mind, mind, mind
[Verse 3]
Limbo this and limbo that
You were this and you were that
Ever know that what you fear is what you find
