Little Things Lyrics
“Little Things” is the fourth track and the second single off Bush’s debut album, Sixteen Stone. The song is about addiction, specifically intravenous methamphetamine use.
[Verse 1]
I bleach the sky every night
Loaded on wrong, and further from right
Spinning around, two howling moons
'Cause they're always there, whatever I do
[Verse 2]
The river is loaded, I've been there today
Took it some questions, she does me again
I'd die in your arms, if you were dead too
Here comes a lie, we will always be true
[Pre-Chorus]
Going up when coming down
Scratch away, way, way, way, way
[Chorus]
It's the little things that kill
Tearing at my brains again
Oh, the little things that kill
The little things that kill
[Verse 3]
Bigger you give, bigger you get
We're boss at denial, but best at forget
Cupboard is empty, we really need food
Summer is winter, and you always knew
