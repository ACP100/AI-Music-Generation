Stay Another Day Lyrics
(Stay now, stay now)
Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I could take the pain
(Stay now, stay now)
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
Oh don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss
(Stay now, stay now)
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
Don't you know we've come too far now
Just to go and try to throw it all away
Thought I heard you say you love me
That your love was gonna be here to stay
I've only just begun to know you
All I can say is won't you stay just one more day?
(Stay now, stay now)
Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I could take the pain
(Stay now, stay now)
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
Oh don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss
(Stay now, stay now)
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
