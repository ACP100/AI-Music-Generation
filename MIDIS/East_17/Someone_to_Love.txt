Someone to Love Lyrics
First Thing in the morning when you just arrose your eyes still closed
Your getting up, your feeling down, maybe it cos your beds creased on one side
You can't hide your face was smiling while you heart wears a frown
Always moving on, no place to go home living alone why should it have to be this way?
Chorus- We all need someone to love
We all need someone to love
Holding and kissing you
When you go missin you
Keeping you warm from the cold of the night
We all need oh someone to love
Your running your hiding you hurt inside
For memories you can't get away
From the pain in your heart
Tossing your turning you'll see all you would learn
In a childhood dream can keep it together while your world falls apart
Your just like them, they don't agree, living alone why does it have to be this way?
Repeat chorus
Holding and kissing you when you go missing you
Keeping you warm from the cold of the night
And to be your companion its all understanding your
Every need to be alright
Holding and kissing you when you go missing you
Keeping you warm from the cold of the night
And to be your companion its all understanding your
Every need to be alright
