Hold My Body Tight Lyrics
[Intro]
Oh, hold my body tight
Hold that body (Body, body)
Body tight (Hold me)
[Verse 1]
Oh, hold me
I see you over there
Body would I love to share, oh
I hold you in my dreams
But then I wake up
Just a dream
[Pre-Chorus]
I'd do anything for you
Steal a star down from the sky
Write a song for birds to sing (Write a song for birds to sing)
All I ask of you, yeah
Just one thing, baby
Just one thing, just one thing
[Chorus]
Hold my body tight (Hold that body)
All night
Never let me go, oh
Hold my body tight (Hold that body)
All night
Never tell me no (Body tight)
Hold me
