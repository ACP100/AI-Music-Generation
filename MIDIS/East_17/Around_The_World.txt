Around the World Lyrics
[Intro]
Yeah
Oh
Been around the world
Been around the world
[Verse 1]
Seen the seas seven, sailed across them all
Seen the moon rise over Paris and I watched her gently fall
On to the beat, keep moving, never stopping
Though sometimes, I feel like dropping, gotta keep on
And be strong, avoid the wrong
'Cause in this life you walk alone through the danger zone
Until you get home
[Chorus]
Been around the world but there's no place like home
Oh baby
Been around the world but there's no place like home
Oh baby
[Post-Chorus]
Take me home where my soul belongs
[Verse 2]
Been above the clouds that paint the sky
Stood below the cosmos and I pondered on a why
Back to the track, in fact I'm breaking through I never knew that you would
Turn and walk away to stay and leave me standing on my own
Far from me like a nomad, sad, bad
Dreams about togetherness that we never had
