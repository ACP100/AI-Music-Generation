Itâ€™s Alright Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Don't you worry, cos it's alright
Don't you worry, child of the night
Cos in the morning
Come with the new day sun
Love - an everlasting light
[Refrain]
We are the seed of the new breed
We'll succeed our time has come
We are the new
These words are true
Let the light of love shine through
[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's really alright
It's alright
It's really alright
[Chorus]
Alright, alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright it's really alright
