I Canâ€™t Get Enough Lyrics
I want to watch for twentyfour hours
Girl I want you hold you tight
I can not sleep becouse I feeling power outside
It's going around, in my mind
You make me so crazy for all, crazy for all
I can't get enough for you love, baby
I can't get enough for you love, for you love
Whatever I do I'm thinking of you
You known is true
I can't get enough for you love, baby
I can't get enough for you love, for you love
Whatever I do I'm thinking of you
You known is true
And God knowns how much I was praying
Now I found a perfect love
It so extreme at mean what I say to you
But I can't get enough
You make me so crazy for love
Crazy for love, crazy for love
I can't get enough for you love, baby
I can't get enough for you love, for you love
Whatever I do I'm thinking of you
You known is true
