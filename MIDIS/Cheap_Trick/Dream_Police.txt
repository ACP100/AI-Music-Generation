Dream Police Lyrics
This song is referring to one’s conscience which is the Dream Police. In the song his conscience makes him feel guilty and this guilt won’t let him sleep.
[Chorus]
The 
dream police
They live inside in my head
The dream police
They come to me in my bed
The dream police
They're coming to arrest me
Oh no
[Verse 1]
You know that talk is cheap
And those rumors ain't nice
And when I fall asleep
I don't think I'll survive
The night
The night
[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause they're waiting for me
They're looking for me
Every single night
They're driving me insane
Those men inside my brain
[Chorus]
The dream police
They live inside in my head
(Live inside in my head)
The dream police
They come to me in my bed
(Come to me in my bed)
The dream police
They're coming to arrest me
Oh no
