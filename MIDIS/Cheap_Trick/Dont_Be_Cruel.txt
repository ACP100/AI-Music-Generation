Donâ€™t Be Cruel Lyrics
Well you know I can be found
Sitting all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please forget the past
The future's bright ahead
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of
Don't stop thinkin' of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over and love me
You know I want you to stay
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Let's walk down to the preacher
Let's say "Hey, I do"
And then I know you'll want me
And you'll know I want you too
