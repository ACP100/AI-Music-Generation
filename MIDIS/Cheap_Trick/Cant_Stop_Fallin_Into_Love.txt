Can’t Stop Fallin’ Into Love Lyrics
Hey, little ladies
There's some cool young dude
Just standin' in line
And waitin' for you
There's a girl in the corner
With a jacked-up dress
She's got legs for miles
But her face looks a mess
There's always somethin' for everyone
But a love can be suicide, oh yeah
It's just what you've been waiting for
And I know it can't be denied, yeah
Can't stop fallin' into love
What's my heart been dreamin' up
Who's that falling' into love
Is it you I'm thinkin' of
Hey rock 'n rollers
What's happenin' with you
You've got the itch
And I've got it too
It's hard to be a winner every time
But I know you take it
You can make it all right
