Root Lyrics
[Verse 1]
To be forced under
I look unto your home because
We gave our eyes but no one will
Yes, I know, because
[Chorus]
To heed the cause I will be barred
But you won't
We are here to love heart
He's up inside, we start to cry
Just because I will afford
Living in me is so poor
Deliver me there
[Verse 2]
To be judged by one or licked by three
And your holes enclose
We gave our eyes but no one will
Yes I know, because
[Chorus]
To heed the cause I will be barred
But you won't
We are here to love heart
He's up inside, we start to cry
Just because I will afford
Living in me is so poor
Deliver me up
