Rollin’ and Tumblin’ Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Well, I rolled 'n' tumbled
I cried the whole night long
Oh well, I rolled 'n' tumbled
I cried the whole night long
Oh well, I had the feelin', baby
Something's goin' on wrong
[Verse 2]
Oh well, I really love you, baby
Come on and say you'll be mine
Oh well, I really love you, baby
Come on and say you'll be mine
Well, if you don't like my taters
Don't you dig up my vine
[Verse 3]
Oh well, I cried last night, mama
I cried the night before
Oh well, I cried last night, mama
I cried the night before
Oh well, I had the feelin', baby
You don't love me no more
[Guitar Solo]
