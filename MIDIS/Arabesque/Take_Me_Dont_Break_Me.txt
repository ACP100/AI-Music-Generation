Take Me, Donâ€™t Break Me Lyrics
He picks me up in his Jaguar
The lady-killer
The movie star
I'm the girl who won the price
To spend an ev'ning by his side
The night is warm and the moon is full -
We drink Champagne in the swimming-pool
He kisses me but I have no fear
When I feel that heaven is near
I say:
Take me
Take me
Don't break me
Break me
Take me
Take me don't break me
Break me
Your love is only dynamite -
It is a most exiting night
What I feel is pure delight
