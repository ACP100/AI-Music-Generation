Montego Bay Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Vernon'll meet me when the 
BOAC
 lands
Keys to the 
MG
 will be in his hands
Adjust to the drivin' and I'm on my way
It's all on the right side in Montego Bay
Sing out
[Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Come sing me loud
Come sing me Montego Bay
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
[Verse 2]
'N' Gillian'll meet me like a brother would
I think I remember but it's twice as good
Like how cool the rum is from his silver tray
I thirst to be thirsty in Montego Bay
Sing out
[Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Come sing me loud
Come sing me Montego Bay
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
