Oh the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And it shows them pearly white
Just a 
jackknife
 has old 
Macheath
, babe
And he keeps it outta sight
You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears old Macheath, babe
So there's never, never a trace o' red
Now, on the side walk
Ooh Sunday morning, ah, ah
Lies a body just oozin' life, eek!
An' someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?
There's a tugboat, ah, ah, ah-ah
Down by the river, don't you know?
Where a cement bag's just a-droopin' on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten, old Mack he's back in town
Now did ya hear about Louie Miller?
He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard earned cash
And now Macheath, spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done somethin' rash?
