It was late at night on the open road
Speeding like a man on the run
A lifetime spent preparing for the journey
He is closer now and the search is on
Reading from a map in the mind
Yes there's that ragged hill
 and there's a boat on 
the river
And when the rain came down, he heard a wild dog howl
There were voices in the night
Don't do it
Voices out of sight
Don't do it
Too many men have failed before, whatever you do
[Chorus]
Don't pay the ferryman
Don't even fix a price
Don't pay the ferryman
Until he gets you to the other side
In the rolling mist, then he gets on board
Now there'll be no turning back
Beware that hooded old man at the rudder
And then the lightning flashed and the thunder roared
And people calling out his name
And dancing bones that jabbered-and-a-moaned on the water
