MacArthur Park Lyrics
There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sky
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one
I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
And I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passions flow like rivers through the sky
But after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wonderin' why
MacArthur Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down...
Someone left the cake out in the rain
And I don't think that I can take it
'cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no!
Oh, no-o-o
