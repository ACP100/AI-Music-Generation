Whoâ€™s Johnny Lyrics
[Intro]
Ow
Oh-oh, yeah
[Verse 1]
There she goes and knows I'm dying
When she says
"Who is Johnny?"
Games with names that girl is playing
All she says is
"Who is Johnny?"
[Verse 2]
I tried to understand because I'm people too
And playing games is part of human nature
My heart's in overdrive
It's great to be alive
[Chorus]
"Who's Johnny?" she said
And smiled in her special way
"Johnny," she said
"You know I love you"
"Who's Johnny?" she said
And tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away, alright
Whoa-whoa-whoa, oh yeah
