Substitute Lyrics
Sam
You've been waiting much too long now
It looks like she's not coming home
Sam
You've been loyal, true and faithful
All this time with being alone
If I could get that same dedication
I'd give you everything in creation
If she doesn't come back (If she doesn't come back)
I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me, ohoho
Don't you know I'll be your substitute
Whenever you need me, oho
Sam
Every day you waited for her
I've been waiting here for you
Sam
All this time I've been lonely
I know what you've been going through
I'll wait until my chances occur
'Cause you can't keep relying on her
If she doesn't come back (If she doesn't come back)
