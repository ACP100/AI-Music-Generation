Save Me Lyrics
[Chorus]
Save me
Take me away to the moonlight
The people around me don't feel right
What are we doing here?
Save me
Take me away from the action
For you are the only attraction
Take me away from here
[Verse 1]
The party's on and one by one
The cars arrive and the people come
And I wonder if there will be anybody here alone
Another married guy tries to catch my eye
Should I smile or should I sigh?
Then you walked through the door and I saw
That you were all on your own
[Chorus]
Save me
Take me away to the moonlight
The people around me don't feel right
What are we doing here?
Come on and save me
Let's get away from the action
For you are the only attraction
Take me away from here
