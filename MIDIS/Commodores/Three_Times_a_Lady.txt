[Verse 1]
Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud
[Chorus]
You're once, twice, three times a lady

And I love you, I love you
[Verse 2]

[Chorus]
You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you, I love you
[Verse 3]
When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart
