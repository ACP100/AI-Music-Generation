Spider Fingers Lyrics
So nice to be here
With all you good people
Is anybody listening
What we're doing tonight
Could you give us a chance
While you hit the sauce
I might try a little flash up here
Just to get ourselves across (Hit it)
Let the spirit linger
Well-uh, get up (Hey)
And do the spider fingers
Check the spider fingers (Check it!)
I could show you on a table
I could show you on a chair
It's best shown on the black and whites
I know I could take you there
It's just a little hand trick
A little prestidigitation
Better get out your Hanon
A little practice and repetition
Well, we better do something
Before they tell us to get lost
Sometimes you've just got to repeat yourself
Just to get your point across (Hit it)
