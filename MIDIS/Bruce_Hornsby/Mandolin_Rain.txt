Mandolin Rain Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The song came and went
Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you've got 'til you lose it all again
[Chorus]
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears as they roll
Down my face as she turns to go
[Verse 2]
A cool evening dance
Listenin' to the bluegrass band takes the chill from the air
Until they play the last song
Bluegrass band
[Instrumental]
I'll do my time keeping you off my mind
But there's moments that I find I'm not feeling so strong
