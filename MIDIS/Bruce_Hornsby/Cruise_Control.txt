Cruise Control Lyrics
It's been a long time coming
This feeling I've got
Things'll always go your way
Such a long shot
Been so deep in the hole
Thought I'd never crawl out
Anything can happen, whoa
I know that now
One slip, one fall
A turn of the head can change it all
A step ahead, a step behind
A blink of an eye at the wrong time
North, south, east and west
Spin the wheel and hope for the best
No regrets and it's on we roll
Put it in drive and set the cruise control
Walk tall and away you go
Wheels roll and the whistle will blow
Many miles, oh, I may roam
Put it in drive and set the cruise control
He was holding on, he trusted me
Then he slipped away
He fell hard and now
I've just got myself to blame
