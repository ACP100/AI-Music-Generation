Country Doctor Lyrics
Deep down in the south county
Over where the paper mill runs
Lived a man, a young country doctor
With the perfect wife and sons
Well, he worked his days
And on Sundays he'd pray
And nobody knew
Why the wife slowly withered away
I saw the country doctor
To ask him what was wrong with me
He was caught unaware, accidental and devil-may-care:
Behind the curtain, I see two shadows in front of me
Whoa, nobody knows the trouble I've seen
My guess, there was another woman
And with the kids and the money, was a lot to lose
He said she had a rare affliction
And he was doing all he could do
And we all believed him
Felt so sorry, and then -
I thought once he was a fine man -
Now, I don't remember when
Well, I saw the country doctor
To ask him what was wrong with me
He was caught unaware, accidental and devil-may-care:
Behind the curtain, I see bottles unmarked in front of me
Whoa, nobody knows the trouble I've seen
