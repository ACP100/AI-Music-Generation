Stander On The Mountain Lyrics
And he stands at the banquet room bar
Looking over the crowd
The reunion band playing too loud
And he sees his fellow old star
Looks him up and down
Sees a little of himself in his frown
The stander on the mountain
Looking for the fountain to drink some, to think some
About the old days
King of the mountain
Nothing could be found of the old ways, the old days
When he was the one
And the stander on the mountain runs
Let us sit and talk of old times
That's what we're supposed to do
And you don't look a day over thirty-two
Yes we were so funny and wild
There's an old friend of mine
Says I'm looking back most all the time
And the stander on the mountain
Listens to the sound of the city streets, the lonely heat
The town he once owned
King of the mountain
Nothing could be found of the old ways, the old days
When he was the one
And the stander on the mountain runs
King of the hill runs away
