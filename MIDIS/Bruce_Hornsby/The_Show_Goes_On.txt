The Show Goes On Lyrics
[Verse 1]
What's the long face, what's all the crying for?
Didn't you expect it when you opened your door?
To the man with the long coat, and the long list of victims
Everybody watching knows he's the one keeping the score
[Pre-Chorus]
From where she sits, everyone stands in judgment
People watching as the curtain falls down
See the lights do a long slow fade
[Chorus]
The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
Everyone watching all along
The show goes on
As the autumn's coming and the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes on
[Verse 2]
Some say she's alright, some say she'll never learn
Some rush into things, some stand and wait their turn
I've been here all along standing here all this time
But you never noticed, just let the same tired flames burn
[Pre-Chorus]
From where I sits, everyone stands in judgment
And everybody watching as the curtain falls down
See the lights do a long slow fade
