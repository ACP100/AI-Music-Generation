And I Love You So Lyrics
[Verse 1]
And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived 'til now
I tell them, "I don't know"
[Verse 2]
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
[Chorus]
And yes, I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
And you love me, too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do
