Black Coffee Lyrics
[Verse 1: Shaznay]
Night swimming, beach walking
Always silent, never talking
Then you call my name
And I know inside I love you
Sail away, I miss you more
Until you see the shore
There I will be waiting
Anticipating
[Pre-Chorus: All]
Each moment is new
Freeze the moment
Each moment is cool
Freeze the moment
[Chorus: Natalie & Nicole, 
Melanie
]
I wouldn't wanna be
Anywhere else but here
I wouldn't wanna change
Anything at all (
Anything, oh, I
)
I wouldn't wanna take
Everything out on you
Though I know I do (
Although I know I do
)
Every time I fall
