[Intro: All]
I know where it's at
I know where it's at (I know where it's at)
I know where it's at (I know where it's at)
I know, I know, I know where it's at
[Chorus: All]
If you wanna have a good time
I know where it's at
If you know you got something on your mind
I know where it's at
If you know that you wanna get on down
I know where it's at
Don't deny, don't be shy
Just come around
[Verse 1: Shaznay]
I've been watching you and I know you like to party, baby
And you know that that sounds a really good to me, yeah
Everybody wants to hang out at my party, baby
Don't you know that this is the only place to be?
Don't you wanna come and see it
[Pre-Chorus 1: Melanie, (Natalie & Nicole)]
If you know that you wanna get on down (Ooh, bop bop)
No need to worry cause All Saints will be around (Ooh, bop bop)
So if you're feeling kinda low, well baby don't (Ooh, bop bop)
Cause I'll be here right (Right here) by your side (Your side) ready to flow (Ready to flow)
