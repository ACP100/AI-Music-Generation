Bootie Call Lyrics
[Intro: Shaznay & 
All
]
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, 
bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, bring it, bring it on now
Bring it on, 
bring it, bring it on now
[Verse 1: Shaznay, 
Natalie
 & 
All
]
Never stop giving good love
'Cause that's what I call you for (
Yeah, what's up, baby?
)
Never stop, baby, give it up
'Cause I know where it came from, 
you got more
 (
That's right
)
I like playing games and if it's all the same
You can bring it on with the rough stuff
Then give me your love, I don't wanna be tamed
[Verse 2: Melanie, 
Shaznay
 & 
Nicole
]
I need a man to be a real man
In order of what I got in store
Always finish what you start, baby
And always havin' me 
beg for more
You know I wanna be diggy-down, boy
But I don't get around
Jimmy has to ride in your pocket or lock him in your wallet
It's just a booty call
