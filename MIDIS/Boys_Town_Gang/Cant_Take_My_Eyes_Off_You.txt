Canâ€™t Take My Eyes Off You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
Oh, I want to hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off of you
[Verse 2]
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothin' else to compare
The thought of you leaves me weak
There're no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Oh, then let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
[Chorus]
I love you, baby and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say
Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you
