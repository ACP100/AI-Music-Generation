I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand

But those days I thought my eyes had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

Now I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound of a windmill going around
I guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune
