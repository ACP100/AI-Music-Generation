Circle in the Sand Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Sundown all around
Walking through the summer's end
Waves crash, baby, don't look back
I won't walk away again
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, anywhere you go
We are bound together
I begin, baby, where you end
Some things are forever
[Chorus]
Circle in the sand, round and round
Never ending love is what we've found
And you complete the heart of me
Our love is all we need
Circle in the sand (circle in the sand)
Circle in the sand (circle in the sand)
[Verse 2]
Cold wind, tide moves in
Shivers in the salty air
Day breaks, my heart aches
I will wait for you right here
