[Verse 1]
I'm mad about you
You're mad about me, babe
Couple of fools run wild, aren't we?
Pushing the day into the nighttime
Somewhere between the two, we start to see
[Chorus]
Mad about you (
Mad about you
)
Lost in your eyes (
Reason aside
)
Mad about love (
Mad about you
)
You and I
[Verse 2]
Something about you right here beside me
Touches the touched part of me like I can't believe
Pushing the night into the daytime
Watching the sky's first light
While the city sleeps
[Chorus]
Mad about you (
Mad about you
)
Lost in your eyes (
Reason aside
)
Mad about love (
Mad about you
)
You and I
