[Chorus]
You better think (Think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (Think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free
[Verse 1]
Let's go back, let's go back
Let's go way on to way back when
I didn't even know you

I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degrees

Think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (Think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free
[Refrain]
'Cause freedom (Freedom)
Stands for freedom (Freedom)
Oh, freedom
Yeah, freedom, right now
Freedom (Freedom)
Oh, freedom (Freedom)
You need you some freedom
Oh, freedom, oh, right now
Yeah, think about it!
You, think about it!
