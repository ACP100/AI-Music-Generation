[Verse 1: Speech]
See I was restin' at the park mindin' my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin'
Investigation maybe she was demonstratin'
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was goin' great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started buggin' out
Drinkin' the 40 oz
, 
goin' the nigga route
Disrespectin' my black queen
Holdin' their crotches and bein' obscene
At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and yes they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear (
Boom!
)
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearin' brothers dissin' it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezin' parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me, see
