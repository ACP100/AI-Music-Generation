[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
[Refrain]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
[Verse 1]

If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower
[Refrain]

 For fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance)
 For fear tonight is all
(Let's sway) You could look into my eyes
(Let's sway) Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight
