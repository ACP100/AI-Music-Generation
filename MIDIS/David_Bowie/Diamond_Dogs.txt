[Spoken Intro]
This ain't rock 'n' roll, this is genocide!
[Verse 1]
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's Freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal
[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) 
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, 
they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, 
they call them the Diamond Dogs
[Verse 2]
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go
Meet his little hussy
 
with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilised
