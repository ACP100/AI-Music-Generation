This Is Not America Lyrics
This Is Not America is a song by Pat Metheny Group and rock singer David Bowie, taken from the soundtrack for the film The Falcon and the Snowman.  Metheny later said the lyrics were profound and meaningful.
[Intro]
This is not America (Sha la la la la)
[Verse 1]
Little piece of you
The little peace in me will die
This is not a miracle
For this is not America
[Verse 2]
Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare too long
This is not America
For this is not the miracle
[Pre-Chorus]
There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea
[Chorus]
For this is not America
(Sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la)
This is not America, no
This is not (Sha la la la la)
