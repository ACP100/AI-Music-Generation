Monster Mash Lyrics
I was working in my lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
My monster from the slab began to arise
When suddenly to my surprise
He did the Mash
He did the Monster Mash
The Monster Mash
It was a graveyard smash
It was a smash
It caught on in a flash
The Monster Mash
He did the Monster Mash
From the hall of gore in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes
He did the Mash
He did the Monster Mash
The Monster Mash
It was a graveyard smash
It was a smash
It caught on in a flash
The Monster Mash
He did the Monster Mash
