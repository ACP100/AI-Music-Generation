Impossible Lyrics
(Show me where
Someone like me can
Make a stand
'Cause I find you a little impossible)
Give me life the "highs" and "lows"
Love, I'm trying to hold
Weaker I get every day
Lose control of the things that I say
Tell me how can I get right
Like a dog without his bite
Don't know which way way to go
Don't know what I'm looking for
Meditate all the time
Hoping that I could find
A ladder that I could climb
To get this off my mind
Until then I'll just be trapped
In your arms I'm deeply wrapped
Before I lose control
I start to scream and scold
(Show me a land where someone like me can make a stand
Make any living
When all that you can is tear down all you don't understand)
