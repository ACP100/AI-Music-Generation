More And More Lyrics
[Chorus: Shirin Amour]
More and more and more
I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more
There's so much we don't wanna do
[Post-Chorus: Shirin Amour]
'Cause we lie, we cheat and we learn from each and every heart affair
Yes, we lie, we cheat and we hurt 'till somebody's in despair
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1: Captain Hollywood]
Boom, keep in tune
Hollywood will soon left to a point
Right to the point
Smokin', like it's a joint
Makin'
Ain't got time to be fakin'
It's my turn and I'm takin'
Everything without shakin', yo, here with the bacon
Happy is how we should be
Realize that we are wealthy
Livin' here on this earth
Enjoy what it's worth
Anger left behind you
Just don't let it find you
Love will not remain
As long as you complain
