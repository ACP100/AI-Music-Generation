Too Late Now Lyrics
This song was written for the 1951 musical film Royal Wedding and is sung by Ellen Bowen (Jane Powell) to the young English lord (Peter Lawford) whom sheâ€™s fallen in love with.
[ELLEN]
Too late now to forget your smile
The way we cling when we've danced awhile
Too late now to forget and go on
To someone new
Too late now to forget your voice
The way one word makes my heart rejoice
Too late now to imagine myself
Away from you
All the things we've done together
I relive when we're apart
All the tender fun together
Stays on in my heart
How could I ever close the door
And be the same as I was before?
Darling, no! No, I can't anymore
It's too late now
