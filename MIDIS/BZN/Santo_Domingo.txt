Santo Domingo Lyrics
I dream of my tropical island
Down in the Carribbean sea
The blue skies, the beach and the coconuts
Oh, baby, and you and me
Listen to the conga
When they play the rumba
In my dreams I am dancing with you
Santo Domingo, place in the sun
Tropical island, island of fun
Singin' songs, oh, nanana
Singin' songs of love
Summer nights together in Santo Domingo
The tropical night was falling
And darkened our hut of bamboo
Just lit by the light of the silvery moon
I made love that first night with you
Listen to the conga
When they play the rumba
In my dreams I am dancing with you
Santo Domingo, place in the sun
Tropical island, island of fun
Singin' songs, oh, nanana
Singin' songs of love
Summer nights together in Santo Domingo
