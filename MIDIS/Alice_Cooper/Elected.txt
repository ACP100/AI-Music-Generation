Elected Lyrics
They didnâ€™t vote for Alice; they re-elected Richard Nixon.
[Verse 1]
I'm top prime cut of meat, I'm your choice
I wanna be elected
I'm your yankee doodle dandy in a gold Rolls Royce
I wanna be elected
Kids want a savior, they don't need a fake
I wanna be elected
We're all gonna rock to the rules that I make
I wanna be elected
[Chorus]
Elected, elected, yeah
Respected, yeah
Elected
[Spoken]
Good evening Mr. & Mrs. America
And all ships at sea
This candidate is taking the country by storm
[Verse 2]
I never lied to you, I've always been cool
I wanna be elected
I gotta get the vote, and I told you 'bout school
I wanna be elected
