Hello Hooray Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hello, hooray, let the show begin, I've been ready
Hello, hooray, let the lights grow dim, I've been ready
[Chorus]
Ready as this audience that's coming here to dream
Loving every second, every moment, every scream
I've been waiting so long to sing my song
And I've been waiting so long for this thing to come
Yeah, I've been thinking so long I was the only one
[Verse 2]
Roll out, roll out
With your American dream and its recruits, I've been ready
Roll out, roll out
With your circus freaks and hula hoops, I've been ready
[Chorus]
Ready as this audience that's coming here to dream
Loving every second, every moment, every scream
I've been waiting so long to sing my song
And I've been waiting so long for this thing to come
Oh, I've been thinking so long I was the only one
[Bridge]
I can stand here strong and thin
And I can laugh when this thing begins
