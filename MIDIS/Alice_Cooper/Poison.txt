Your cruel device
Your blood like ice
One look could kill
My pain, your thrill
[Chorus]

I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (Too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison

Your skin, so wet
Black lace on sweat
[Chorus]
I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (And pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you, but you're under my skin (Deep in)
I wanna kiss you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains
Poison
