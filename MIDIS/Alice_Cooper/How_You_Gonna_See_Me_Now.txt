How You Gonna See Me Now Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Dear darlin', surprised to hear from me?
Bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily
Just to let you know I'm gonna be home soon
I'm kinda awkward and afraid time has changed your point of view
[Chorus]
How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly, babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In, oh, so many ways
How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home?
[Verse 2]
Listen darlin', now I'm heading for the west
Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess
Yes, I'm worried, honey, guess that's natural though
It's like I'm waiting for a welcome sign like a hobo in the snow
[Chorus]
How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly, babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In, oh, so many ways
How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home?
