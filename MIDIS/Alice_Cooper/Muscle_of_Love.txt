Muscle of Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Oh, who's the queen of the locker room?
Who's the cream of the crop?
Poor Joey took her to the matinee
Said, "God, she wouldn't stop"
[Chorus]
Holy muscle of love
My heart's a muscle
[Verse 2]
Well, I must have come to that crazy age
Where everythin' is hot
'Cause I don't know if the things I'm thinkin'
Are normal thoughts or not
[Chorus]
Holy muscle of love
Well, I got a muscle of love
[Interlude]
Yeah
Ooh
[Guitar Solo]
