You and Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When I get home from work
I wanna wrap myself around you
I wanna take you and squeeze you
'Til the passion starts to rise
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna take you to heaven
That would make my day complete
[Chorus]
But you and me ain't no movie stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed, some lovin' and TV, yeah
And that's enough for a workin' man
What I am is what I am
And I tell you, babe, well that's enough for me
[Verse 2]
Sometimes when you're asleep
And I'm just starin' at the ceiling
I wanna reach out and touch you
But you just go on dreamin'
[Pre-Chorus]
If I could take you to heaven
That would make my day complete
