Shooting Star Lyrics
This song was inspired by the young deaths of rock stars Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison.
[Verse 1]
Johnny was a schoolboy when he heard his first Beatles song
'Love Me Do,' I think it was, from there it didn't take him long
Got himself a guitar, used to play every night
Now he's in a rock 'n' roll outfit and everything's all right
[Bridge]
Don't you know?
[Verse 2]
Johnny told his mama, "Hey, Mama, I'm goin' away
I'm gonna hit the big time, gonna be a big star someday," yeah
Mama came to the door with a teardrop in her eye
Johnny said, "Don't cry, Mama," smiled and waved good-bye
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know, yeah yeah
[Chorus]
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Don't you know, don't you know
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
[Post-Chorus]
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are
