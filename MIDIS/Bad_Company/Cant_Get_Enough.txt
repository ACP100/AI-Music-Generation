Canâ€™t Get Enough Lyrics
[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Well, I take whatever I want
And, baby, I want you
You give me something I need
Now tell me I got something for you
[Pre-Chorus]
Come on
Come on
Come on and do it
Come on and-uh do what you do
[Chorus]
I can't get enough of your love, huh
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
Listen
[Verse 2]
Well, it's late, and I want love
Love that's gonna break me in two
Don't you hang me up in your doorway
Don't you hang me up like you do, say it!
