Two Tickets to Paradise Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I've got a surprise especially for you
It's something that both of us have always wanted to do
[Refrain]
And you've waited so long
You've waited so long
You've waited so long
You've waited so long
[Verse 2]
I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here
I've got two tickets in my pocket now, baby
We're gonna disappear
[Refrain]
We've waited so long
You've waited so long
We've waited so long
We've waited so long
[Chorus]
I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
I've got two tickets to paradise
