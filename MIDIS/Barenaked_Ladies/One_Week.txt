[Chorus: Steven Page]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry"
Five days since you laughed at me
Saying "Get back together, come back and see me"
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you

But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry
[Verse 1: Ed Robertson]

As I make you stop, think

I summon fish to the dish,
 
although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me, but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know the vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver
