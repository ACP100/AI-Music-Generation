It Never Rains in Southern California Lyrics
This song concerns the struggles of a singer who moves out to California to pursue a career in Hollywood but does not have any success and deteriorates in the process.
[Verse 1]
Got on board a westbound 747
Didn't think before deciding what to do
Ooh, that talk of opportunities
TV breaks and movies
Rang true, sure rang true
[Pre-Chorus]
Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
[Chorus]
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours
[Verse 2]
Out of work, I'm out of my head
I'm out of self respect, I'm out of bread
I'm under-loved, I'm underfed
I wanna go home
[Chorus]
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours
