Catch My Fall Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have the time, so I will sin, yeah
I'm just a boy, but I will win, yeah
Lost songs of lovers, fellow travelers, yeah
Leave me sad and hollow, out of words
[Chorus]
It could happen to you
So think for yourself
If I should stumble
Catch my fall, yeah
If I should stumble
Catch my fall
Catch my fall
[Post-Chorus]
If I should stumble
Catch my fall, ow
If I should stumble
[Verse 2]
Traveled and unwound my own truth, yeah
I've laid my head on the rock of youth, yeah
Trusted and then broken my own word
Just to keep me free in this mad, mad world
