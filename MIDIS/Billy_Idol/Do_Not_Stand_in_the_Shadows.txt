(Do Not) Stand In the Shadows Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hearts which beat to a precise beat
Painting shadows on the wall
We'll cut out cars, drive by bars
All for one, one for all, ah
Like teenage sleaze and comic book cheese
With your heart on your sleeve
Well, you know you won't run and you won't hide
And you jump like a son of a gun, ow
[Chorus]
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow, oh-oh
Do not stand in the shadow
[Verse 2]
Oh lonely, oh lonely
Watching people on my wall
Well, my Mama and Daddy thought they had me fooled
I wasn't thinking, not at all
Well, I got out, not gonna stand
In the dark without a light
Forget ill luck if you believe
That chance can sit and wait, wow
