Baby Baby Lyrics
[Intro]
Baby, baby
Why can't we just stay together?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby
Why can't we just stay forever?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
I wanna roll inside your soul
To know the things that you need and feel
Every time that you're by my side
I can't get serious because you got me (Got me, got me)
[Pre-Chorus]
Cold chill down on my spine
No-no more tears, show me a smile
Cold chill down on my spine
No-no more tears, give me a smile
[Chorus]
Baby, baby
Why can't we just stay together?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby
Why can't we just stay forever?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
