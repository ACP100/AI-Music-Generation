Ay No Digas Lyrics
Ay no digas, que tu no quieres
Que tu no quieres, quieres mi amor
Because I love you, I only want you
Oh, how I need you, that is for sure
If I had sunshine I'd give it to you
If I had fortunes I'd do the same
I'd give the stars to nobody but you
And most of all I'd give you my name
We've been through all kinds of weather
Now is no time to go 'way
If we could just stay together
Then ev'rything will be okay
You'll see
Ay no digas, que tu no quieres
Ay no digas, que tu no quieres
Que tu no quieres, quieres mi amor
Because I love you, I only want you
Oh, how I need you, that is for sure
We've been through all kinds of weather
Now is no time to go 'way
If we could just stay together
Then ev'rything will be okay
You'll see
