Josephine Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There's rain on my window
And I'm thinking of you
Tears on my pillow
But I will come through
[Chorus]
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
And every single step I take
I take for you
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
[Verse 2]
Now there's a storm on my radar
But I can still fly
And you are the reason
The blue in my sky
[Chorus]
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
Josephine
