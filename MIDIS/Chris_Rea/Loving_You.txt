Loving You Lyrics
The night was black with thunder
The streets were wet with rain
Another day goes under
A little bourbon will take the strain
Waiting for my take-home French fries
She smiled and said 'take me away'
We always laughed but I think she means it
But I'm dreaming my life away
Loving you (Loving you)
'Cos loving you
Loving you the way I do
I'm loving you (Loving you)
Loving you, girl
Loving you the way I do (the way I)
The weekend cars are leaving
In a spray of wind and sound
The bar-talk, make believing
And the drinks go easy down
It's back to the all-night take-away
She says 'here comes the man of my dreams'
We always laugh but I think she means it
And I'm spending my time, it seems
Loving you (Loving you)
Just loving you
Loving you the way I do
I'm loving you, girl (Loving you)
Just loving you, yeah
Oh I just can't stop loving you (the way I)
Yeah
Loving you
