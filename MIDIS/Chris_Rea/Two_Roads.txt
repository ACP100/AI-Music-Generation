Two Roads Lyrics
Ain't it funny how you never can tell
It always seems to hit you when it's going so well
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing
Now it's lawyers-at-midnight and the learning begins
Let's take a walk outside in the morning sun
Here ain't working out no battles to be won
Oh darling take a look at you and me
We both love our freedom and we'll always be
Two roads
You can wait a lifetime for the hammer to fall
Some folks get lucky they don't see it at all
We were bound to drift away from the very first day one
Two different journeys and neither was wrong
Let's take a walk outside in the morning sun
Here ain't working out no battles to be won
Oh darling take a look at you and me
We both love our freedom and we'll always be
Two roads
Two different lifetimes we just happened to meet
Traded some good times on the corner of the street
We were no more than strangers attracted to one
And the same sense of freedom but we'll always be on
Two roads
