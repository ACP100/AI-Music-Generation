Fool (If You Think Itâ€™s Over) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
A dying flame
You're free again
Who could love
And do that to you?
All dressed in black
He won't be coming back
Well, save your tears
You've got years and years
[Pre-Chorus]
The pains of seventeens
Unreal, they're only dreams
Save your crying for the day
[Chorus]
Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why
New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun
