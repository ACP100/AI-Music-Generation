Happy Lyrics
[Intro]
(You know what I'm saying?)
[Chorus]
Happy (Sha-la-la)
It's so nice to be happy (Sha-la-la-la)
Everybody should be happy (Sha-la-la)
It's so nice to be happy (Sha-la-la-la)
Happy (Sha-la-la)
It's so nice to be happy (Sha-la-la-la)
It's so nice to be happy (Sha-la-la)
It's so nice to be happy (Sha-la-la-la)
[Verse 1]
I wanna take you to my world
To be happy
'Cause I can't live without your love
Yes, you know
I've never needed anyone to be happy
But that's the way that things go wrong
Yes, you know
[Pre-Chorus]
I was afraid to open my eyes
Don't even know how many tears that I've cried
Now that i've found the love of my life
I don't get down, down, down, down, down
