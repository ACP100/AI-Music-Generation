Goodbye Lyrics
Goodbye
Enough is enough for me baby
You'd better get out of my life
And if you come back to me maybe
Remember i told you goodbye
I've never been so sad in all my life
No one killed me before
Tell me why did you do that
Oh don't tell me everything will be allright
Baby this is the door
It's too late to be sorry
Baby i need a passion in my life
A very special kind of love
Don't care about you
Chorus
There's nothing you can do to change my mind
Cause you've played with my love
It's so hard to forget it
Baby i need a passion in my life
A very special kind of love
Don't care about you
