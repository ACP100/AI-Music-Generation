On the Down Low Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Maxine was 5-foot-9
Had a man, and she didn't mind
Walked up to me nice and slow
What she wanted I did not know
Gave me her pager number
And said call her "anytime"
Then she whispered in my ear
She said
[Chorus]
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it on the down low
She said
My body wants you so (Oh yeah)
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it on the down low
Oh oh, oh oh oh, keep it on the down low
Oh oh, oh oh oh, keep it on the down low
[Verse 2]
She says that he
Doesn't take her anywhere
Used to say sweet things
Acts like he doesn't even care
Deprived of all the things
She misses, wants, wishes and needs
Got hotter than a hundred-and-three
She turned and said to me
