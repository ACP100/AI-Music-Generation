[Verse 1]
I can't remember why we fell apart
From something that was so meant to be, yeah
Forever was the promise in our hearts
Now, more and more, I wonder where you are
[Chorus]
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
I miss you
[Verse 2]
Still have your picture in a frame
Hear your footsteps down the hall
I swear I hear your voice, driving me insane
How I wish that you would call to say
[Chorus]
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
[Bridge]
No more loneliness and heartache
No more crying myself to sleep
Don't want no more wondering about tomorrow
Won't you come back to me, come back to me, oh
