My Next Broken Heart Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You picked me up, you shot me down
Steppin' out all over town
Drove me back to drinkin' in this bar
I found myself a brand new friend
I'm headed down that road again
I'm workin' on my next broken heart
[Verse2]
Happy or sad, it's hard to tell
You taught me how to hurt so well
When it comes to love I know my part
Well, I'll play this game that I can't win
I'll be somebody's fool again
Workin' on my next broken heart
[Chorus]
Well, I thought all along you'd be the death of me
But I met one tonight who wants what's left of me
I've seen that look before, she'll tear my world apart
I'm workin' on my next broken heart
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Yeah, I thought all along you'd be the death of me
Well, I met one tonight who wants what's left of me
I've seen that look before, she'll tear my world apart
I'm workin' on my next broken heart
