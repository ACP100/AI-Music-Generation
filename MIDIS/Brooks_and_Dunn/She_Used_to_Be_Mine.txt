She Used to Be Mine Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She looked so good movin' 'cross the dance floor
Better than the day she left me
Arm in arm with somebody new
Holdin' hands and laughin' like we used to
[Pre-Chorus]
I've got my best smile on, but it's no disguise
It don't hide the pain in these eyes
[Chorus]
I did her so wrong, for so long
Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone
I did my part to break her heart
She walked out on me and tore my world apart
She used to be mine
Oh, she used to be mine
[Verse 2]
It's taken every bit of strength that I have
To keep a hurt look off my face
I can't keep from lookin' back over my shoulder
At the lucky man takin' my place
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if it weren't for my pride, I'd probably take off runnin'
Guess what I'm feelin', is what I got comin'
