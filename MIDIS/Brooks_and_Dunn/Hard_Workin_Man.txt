Hard Workinâ€™ Man Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm a hard-workin' man
I wear a steel hard hat
I can ride, rope, hammer and paint
Do things with my hands that most men can't
I can't get ahead no matter how hard I try
I'm gettin' really good at barely gettin' by
[Verse 2]
Got everything I own
By the sweat of my brow
From my four-wheel drive to my cowboy boots
I owe it all to my blue-collar roots
Feel like I'm workin' overtime on a runaway train
I've got to bust loose from this ball and chain
[Chorus]
I'm a hard, hard-workin' man
I got it all on the line for a piece of the promised land
And I'm burnin' my candle at both ends
'Bout the only way to keep the fire goin' is to outrun the wind
[Piano & Violin Solo]
[Verse 3]
Come Friday night
I like to party hard
I carry on with the Cadillac cuties
Spend my whole week's pay on some weekend beauty
Come Monday mornin' I'm the first to arrive
I ain't nothin' but business, y'all, from nine to five
