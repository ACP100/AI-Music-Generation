That Ainâ€™t No Way to Go Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Lipstick letter 'cross the mirror this mornin'
Said, "Goodbye, baby," you left without warnin'
Like a thief in the night, you ran away with my heart
[Verse 2]
I can't believe my eyes, must be a bad dream
You always said we had a good thing
You never once let on we were fallin' apart
[Chorus]
That ain't no way to go, girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, was it all a lie?
After all this time, that ain't no way to go
[Verse 3]
Gettin' nowhere, I'm tired of thinkin'
Guess I'll do a little wishful drinkin'
And make a whiskey wish upon a star
[Verse 4]
Train whistle blowin' down the track
Lonesome sound says she ain't comin' back
It's such a cold blow from out of the dark
