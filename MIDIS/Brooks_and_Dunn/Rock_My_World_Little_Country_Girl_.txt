Rock My World (Little Country Girl) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She's got a T-Top Camaro with a scoop on the hood
And two big speakers blastin' Johnny B. Goode
Lookin' so sweet it oughta be a crime
She plays with my heart and messes with my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Acts like Madonna but she listens to Merle
Rock my world little country girl
[Verse 2]
She wears snakeskin boots made by Calvin Klein
And cheap sunglasses from the five and dime
All the other girls in school, they give her dirty looks
She got a "A" in math and never cracked a book
[Pre-Chorus]
Sure looks good in her denim and pearls
Rock my world little country girl
[Chorus]
Rock my world, drag me out on the floor
Dance with me 'til I can't dance anymore
One-step, two-step, get in a line
I gotta find a way to make you mine
Rock my world
Woo
