[Intro]
I'm getting ready to put y'all up on something, man
Yo, when you see something ill, know what I mean?
That shit is whoa,

Especially if he got the

 it's whoa
Like you know what I mean?
 Like, yo
[Verse 1]
I had this bad bitch Uptown, she was whoa
Had me fucked up in the head, I mean whoa
Bought the bitch diamonds and pearls,
 
I mean whoa
Shoulda seen them shits shining on her wrist,
 whoa
Now money ain't a problem, see my dough is like whoa
Pulled out my bankroll on y'all niggas like whoa
Floss the blue shrimp from two-tenth like whoa
Faggot wanna peep my blueprints, I'm like whoa
Had to hit the brakes on y'all niggas like whoa
Niggas getting pulled on my block
 like whoa
Coming home within a half an hour like whoa
Fronting like they had the manpower
 like whoa
More or less,
 Moreso
[Chorus]
I'll rip your torso, I live the fast life
Come through in the Porsche slow like whoa
My niggas, like dough, light 'dro
Nitro, might flow, nice clothes like whoa
