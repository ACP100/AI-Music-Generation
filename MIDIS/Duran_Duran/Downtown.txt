Downtown Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Deliver us from evil
We go with the flow
But here's a little secret
I think you ought to know
Providers and abusers
They know where to go
With Sunday refugees from Sunday TV shows
[Chorus]
Downtown all of the way down
Downtown all of the way downtown
[Verse 2]
Let's sink imagination
Past your wildest wild
(all of the way downtown
Go way below below below
Is it such a crime?
The uptown can't teach you how to live
They don't have the time
Coz where i'm going to take you
Is a state of mine
[Chorus]
