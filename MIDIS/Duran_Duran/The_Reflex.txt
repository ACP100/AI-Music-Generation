The Reflex Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You've gone too far this time
But I'm dancing on the Valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line
I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand, oh woah
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand, oh woah
[Refrain]
Why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it
Oh, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it
[Chorus]
The reflex is a lonely child who's waiting by the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over 
lucky clover
, isn't that bizarre?
And every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark
