[Verse 1]
You saw me standing by the wall
Corner of a main street
And the lights are flashing on your window sill
All alone ain't much fun
So you're looking for the thrill
And you know just what it takes
And where to go

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now

[Verse 2]
Feel the breeze deep on the inside
Look you down into your well (Do-do-do-do-do)
If you can, you'll see the world in all his fire (Do-do-do-do-do)
Take a chance like all dreamers
You can't find another way (Do-do-do-do-do)
You don't have to dream it all
Just live a day (Do-do-do-do-do)
[Chorus]
Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after
Save it till the morning after
Save it till the morning after
