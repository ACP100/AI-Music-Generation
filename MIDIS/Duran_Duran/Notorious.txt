Notorious Lyrics
[Intro]
No-no-Notorious
Notorious
(Ah)
No-no-Notorious
[Verse 1]
I can't read about it
Burns the skin from your eyes
I'll do fine without it
Here's one you don't compromise
Lies come hard in disguise
They need to fight it out
Not wild about it
Lay your seedy judgements
Who says they're part of our lives?
[Chorus]
You own the money
You control the witness
I'll leave you lonely
Don't monkey with my business
You pay the prophets to justify your reasons
I heard your promise, but I don't believe it
That's why I've done it again
