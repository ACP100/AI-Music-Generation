Union of the Snake Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Telegram force and ready
I knew this was a big mistake
There's a fine line drawing
My senses together
And I think it's about to break
[Pre-Chorus]
If I listen close, I can hear them singers, oh ho ho
Voices in your body coming through on the radio, ho ho
[Chorus]
The Union of the Snake
 is on the climb
Moving up, it’s gonna race, it’s gonna break
Through the borderline
[Verse 2]
Nightshades on a warning
Give me strength, at least give me a light
Give me anything, even sympathy
There's a chance you could be right
[Pre-Chorus]
If I listen close, I can hear them singers, oh ho ho
Voices in your body coming through on the radio, ho ho
