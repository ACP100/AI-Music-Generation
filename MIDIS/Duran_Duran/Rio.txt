Rio Lyrics
On an episode of the VH1 show True Spin the band explained that “Rio” was a metaphor for their desire to succeed in America.
[Verse 1]
Moving on the floor now, babe, you're a bird of paradise
Cherry ice cream smile, I suppose it's very nice
With a step to your left and a flick to the right
You catch that mirror way out west
You know you're something special
And you look like you're the best
[Chorus]
Her name is Rio, and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande
[Verse 2]
I've seen you on the beach, and I've seen you on TV
Two of a billion stars, it means so much to me
Like a birthday or a pretty view
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you
[Chorus]
Her name is Rio, and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande
