Hungry Like the Wolf (Night Version) Lyrics
[Intro]
Ha-ha!
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do, do-do
And I'm hungry like the wolf
[Verse 1]
Darken the city, night is a wire
Steam in the subway, earth is afire
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do, do-do
Woman, you want me, give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do, do-do
[Chorus]
In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line, in discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf
[Verse 2]
Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do, do-do
High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do, do-do
