Magic Symphony Lyrics
Breakin' down the fences
Breakin' down the rules
The reason for my heartbeat
The mysteries of woods
I talk to my dream
I hear a voice it was callin'
And I couldn't stop Justine
Cause my wild horse was fallin'
(It's a wish) gimme freedom in my dreams
(What a wish) gimme shelter yes it seems
(Yes it seems) bleeding heartaches ever cry
I wanna rock you baby 'til I die
It's a magic symphony
Baby when you're lyin' next to me
I hear violins
You know what it means
Just for tonight
I hear a symphony of love
I see the stars and moon above
I hear your heart I feel your touch deep down inside
Breakin' down the fences
Breakin' down the rules
The reason for my heartbeat
The mysteries of woods
I talk in my sleep
There was a mystical devotion
I hear the rhythm heard the beat
Unknown soldiers in emotion
(It's a dream) gimme freedom in my dreams
(What a wish) gimme shelter yes it seems
(Yes it seems) bleeding heartaches ever cry
I wanna rock you baby 'til I die
