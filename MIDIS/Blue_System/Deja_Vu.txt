Déjà Vu Lyrics
That's no lie no déjà vu
Oh you try and try and try
To steal my heart away away away
Baby just tonight you're so good to me
My number one
90 ways to fight with no guarantee
We can't go wrong
Hmm my heart is a lonely number
B-b-baby I'm more than a lover
K-k-kiss me
Maybe
My love will drive you crazy
It's no déjà vu (déjà vu)
Oh it's like a dream to me (déjà vu)
Baby can't you see
I'll hold you forever
I can make it better
You get what you want L.O.V.E
It's no déjà vu (déjà vu)
You are still a mystery (déjà vu)
Baby can't you see
My heart is in motion
I'll give you devotion
Oh baby you'll do it for me
