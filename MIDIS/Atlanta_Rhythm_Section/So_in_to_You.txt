So in to You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not catch your eyes
Now, I stand here helplessly
Hoping you'll get in to me
[Chorus]
I am so in to you
I can't think of nothing else
I am so in to you
I can't think of nothing else
[Bridge]
Thinking how it's gonna be
Whenever I get you next to me
It's gonna be good
Don't you know?
From your head to your toe
Gonna love you all over
Over and over
Me in to you, you in to me, me in to you
[Refrain]
I'm so in to you
I'm so in to you, oh!
