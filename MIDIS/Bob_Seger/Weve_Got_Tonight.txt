Weâ€™ve Got Tonight Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I know it's late
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
[Pre-Chorus]
Why should we worry?
No one will care girl
Look at the stars so far away
[Chorus]
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?
[Verse 2]
Deep in my soul
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searchin' even after today
