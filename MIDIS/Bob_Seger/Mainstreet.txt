Mainstreet Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember standing on the corner at midnight
Trying to get my courage up
There was this long, lovely dancer in a little club downtown
Loved to watch her do her stuff
[Pre-Chorus]
Through the long, lonely nights she filled my sleep
Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat
[Chorus]
Down on Mainstreet
Down on Mainstreet
[Verse 2]
In the pool halls, the hustlers and the losers
Used to watch 'em through the glass
Well, I'd stand outside at closing time
Just to watch her walk on past
[Pre-Chorus]
Unlike all the other ladies, she looked so young and sweet
As she made her way alone down that empty street
[Chorus]
Down on Mainstreet
Down on Mainstreet
Ooh
