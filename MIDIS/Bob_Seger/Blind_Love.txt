Blind Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Now you're gone
And it's hotels and whiskey and sad luck days
And I don't care if they miss me
I never remember their names
They say if you get far enough away
You'll be on your way back home
Well I'm at the station
And I can't get on the train
[Chorus]
Must be blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Oh blind love
Blind love
Stone blind love
Stone blind love
[Verse 2]
Well the street's turning blue
The dogs are barking and the night has come
And it's tears that are falling
From these brown eyes now
And I wonder where you are
And I whisper your name (I whisper your name)
And the only way to find you
Is if I close my eyes
