Turn the Page Lyrics
[Verse 1]
On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' there to do
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through
[Chorus]
Here I am
On the road again
There I am
On the stage
Here I go
Playin' star again
There I go
Turn the page
[Verse 2]
Well, you walk into a restaurant all strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode
Most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
All the same old clich√©s, "Is it woman, is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered so you don't dare make a stand
