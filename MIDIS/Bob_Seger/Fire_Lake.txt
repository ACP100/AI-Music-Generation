Fire Lake Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Who's gonna ride that chrome three-wheeler?
Who's gonna make that first mistake?
Who wants to wear those 
gypsy leathers
All the way to 
Fire Lake
?
[Verse 2]
Who wants to break the news about Uncle Joe?
You remember Uncle Joe
He was the one afraid to cut the cake
Who wants to tell poor Aunt Sarah?
Joe's run off to Fire Lake
Joe's run off to Fire Lake
[Bridge]
Who wants to brave those bronzed beauties
Lyin' in the sun?
With their long soft hair fallin'
Flyin' as they run
Ah they smile so shy
And they flirt so well
And they lay you down so fast
'Til you look straight up and say
Oh, Lord
Am I really here at last?
