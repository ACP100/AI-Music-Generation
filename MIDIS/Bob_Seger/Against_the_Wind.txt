[Verse 1]
Seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
Janey was lovely
She was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness
With the radio playin' low, and
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn
And nothing left to prove
[Pre-Chorus]
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me, oh-so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
[Chorus]
Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind
[Verse 2]
And the years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home and I
I guess I lost my way
There were oh-so many roads
I was livin' to run
And runnin' to live
Never worried about payin'
Or even how much I owed
