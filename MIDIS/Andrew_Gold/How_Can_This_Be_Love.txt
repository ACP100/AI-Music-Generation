How Can This Be Love Lyrics
[Chorus]
How can this be love if it makes us cry?
How can this be love if it makes us cry?
[Verse 1]
I thought love was everything
I believed in all the good things it would bring
But lately, we have hurt each other bad
And I'm afraid to lose the lovin' that we had
[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to make it good
I did the best I could
[Chorus]
How can this be love if it makes us cry?
How can this be love if it makes us cry?
[Verse 2]
I ask my mama, "What to do?
Is it just a passing thing we're goin' through?"
She said, "Baby, don't be blue
If you get through this, you know your love is true"
[Pre-Chorus]
We tried to make it good
We did the best I could
