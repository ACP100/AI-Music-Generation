Butterfly Kisses Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There's two things I know for sure
She was sent here from heaven
And she's daddy's little girl
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus
And I close my eyes
And I thank god for all of the joy in my life
Oh, but most of all
[Chorus]
For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
"Walk beside the pony, Daddy, it's my first ride"
"I know the cake looks funny, Daddy, but I sure tried"
Oh, with all that I've done wrong
I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning
And butterfly kisses at night
[Verse 2]
Sweet 16 today
She's looking like her mama
A little more everyday
One part woman, the other part girl
To perfume and make-up
From ribbons and curls
Trying her wings out in a great big world
But I remember
