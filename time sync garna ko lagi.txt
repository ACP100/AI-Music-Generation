Pleasse read the prompt in detail before providing answer

my folder structure looks like this:
AI-Music_generation
	-> Artist name
		->song.mid
	-> youtube_results.json
and i have a .json file which looks like this, it has around 10,000 entries:
(example only)
   {
        "artist": "xyz",
        "song": "ookla",
        "url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wro3bqi4Eb8",
       "midi_duration": "HH:MM:SS"
    }

I need you to write a Python script that:
1.  Download the audio from the provided YouTube link directly into memory, without creating a temporary audio file on disk.
2.  Use WhisperX to detect the language of this in-memory audio.
3.  if the detected language is English ('en'), then:
     Transcribe the audio, generating word-level synchronized lyrics with timestamps.
     Embed these word-level lyrics into the provided MIDI file by adding them to the last track +1(e.g., if there are 10 tracks, add to the 11th track).
     Save the updated MIDI file in its original location.
     Generate a separate `.txt` file containing only the full lyrics (no timestamps) and save it in the same directory as the MIDI file.
4.  If the detected language is not English, the script should ignore the song and perform no transcription or MIDI modification.


Where to find the corresponding .mid file?
->the .mid file for above example will be in following way
AI-Music_generation
	-> xyz
		->ookla.mid
		->shanti.mid
		->lukau.mid
where ->shanti.mid  ->lukau.mid are .mid files for other songs of xyz.
